title: "About"
---

I work in software, research, education, and the garden.

I co-founded the [Cosmos] and [Tendermint] projects.

I'm currently CEO of [Informal Systems] 
and President of the [Interchain Foundation].

I'm also an associate at the [Creative Destruction
Lab](https://www.creativedestructionlab.com/people/ethan-buchman/).

I refer to myself as an Internet BioPhysicist, Sustainability Existentialist, Monetary Localist, and PlainText Evangelist

I have a quasi-maintained [CV](https://github.com/ebuchman/resume/blob/master/resume.pdf)

I used to blog more, first on [blogspot](http://easythereentropy.blogspot.com/),
then on [wordpress](https://easythereentropy.wordpress.com/). Now I host my own
blog on [github](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/).

The following more or less sum me up:

---
> "There is nothing in a caterpillar that tells you it's going to be a butterfly."

> *- Buckminster Fuller*

---

> "There are no passengers on spaceship earth. We are all crew."

> *- Marshall McLuhan*

---

> "Human beings were invented by water as a device for transporting itself from
one place to another."

> *- Tom Robbins*

---

> “There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the
Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be
replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. 
>
> There is another theory which states that this has already happened.”

> *- Douglas Adams*

The profile picture is a super-resolution image of actin filaments in a kidney
cell (*Xu et al. Nature Methods 9: 185-188 (2012)*). I believe that 
biophysical mechanics (cytoskeleton, extra-cellular matrix, collagen networks,
etc.) are perhaps more fundamental to understanding organisms than sequences of DNA.
