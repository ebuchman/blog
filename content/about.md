Hi! I'm Ethan Buchman. I grew up in Toronto, Canada,
but spent many years in lovely [Guelph]. 

I co-founded the [Cosmos] and [Tendermint] projects, run [Informal Systems], 
and am now focused on building [Cycles]. 
I have a background in biophysics and computer science, and
more recently have been studying the history of monetary and financial
institutions. 


## What is Cosmos?

Cosmos is a political economic philosophy emphasizing sovereignty and
interoperability for the world's communities. Cosmos pioneered the "app-chain
thesis" and produced some of the most valuable production software for building
custom blockchains (CometBFT, IBC, Cosmos-SDK). I recently [transitioned out of
my role in Cosmos][cosmos-transition] to focus full-time on Cycles. 

## What is Cycles?

[Cycles] is a platform for capital-efficient finance. It's an open clearing protocol 
designed to clear the most debt for the most people with the least money. 
Cycles combines privacy-preserving tech (TEEs and ZKPs) with graph algorithms to provide a novel approach to payments, credit, money, and finance
with widespread risk-reducing benefits both systemically and to individuals. It is the culmination of
years of studying the monetary and financial system and my take on one of the
best possible use-cases of blockchain tech. 

See the [whitepaper] and [this talk] for an overview.

## Education

My [master's thesis] has been widely cited and provides a seminal introduction to 
Tendermint and Proof of Stake systems, and contextualizes the development of blockchain technology
in the history of academic distributed systems research. Blockchains represent
the natural evolution of database systems towards a multi-stakeholder context.

My undergraduate work focused on the biophysics of organisms, the origin of
life, and the thermodynamics of sustainability. That work has heavily informed
my political economic thinking. We live in a biophysical reality.

These days I'm focused on monetary and financial history and institutional
design. I'm quite active at the [Mimbres School].

## More

Find me [on twitter]. 

I'm also an associate at the [Creative Destruction
Lab](https://www.creativedestructionlab.com/people/ethan-buchman/).

I have a quasi-maintained [CV](https://github.com/ebuchman/resume/blob/master/resume.pdf).

I've gone through a few blogging platforms over the years, 
first on [blogspot](http://easythereentropy.blogspot.com/),
then on [wordpress](https://easythereentropy.wordpress.com/). Now I host this
blog on [github](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/).

I explore a lot of my ideas in conference talks, podcasts, and interviews,
which you can find on the [Media] page. 


## Quotes 

Some quotes I'm fond of:

---

> “Everyone can create money; the problem is to get it accepted“

*- Hyman Minsky*

---

> "Once in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right"

*- Robert Hunter*

---

> "Human beings were invented by water as a device for transporting itself from
one place to another."

*- Tom Robbins*

---

> “There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the
Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be
replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. 
>
> There is another theory which states that this has already happened.”

*- Douglas Adams*

The profile picture is a super-resolution image of actin filaments in a kidney
cell (*Xu et al. Nature Methods 9: 185-188 (2012)*). I believe that 
cellular biophysical mechanics (cytoskeleton, extra-cellular matrix, collagen networks,
etc.) are perhaps more fundamental to understanding multi-cellular organisms than sequences of DNA.
Your DNA wouldn't even be able to replicate itself were it not for the
[microtubules].
