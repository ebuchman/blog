title: "About"

Hi! I'm Ethan Buchman. I grew up in Toronto, Canada,
but spent many years in lovely [Guelph]. I work in software, research, education, and the garden.

I co-founded the [Cosmos] and [Tendermint] projects, which I still work on,
as CEO of [Informal Systems] and President of the [Interchain Foundation].

I'm also an associate at the [Creative Destruction
Lab](https://www.creativedestructionlab.com/people/ethan-buchman/).

I'm [active on twitter], where I refer to myself as an *Internet BioPhysicist, Sustainability Existentialist, Monetary Localist, and PlainText Evangelist*.

I have a quasi-maintained [CV](https://github.com/ebuchman/resume/blob/master/resume.pdf).

I used to blog more, first on [blogspot](http://easythereentropy.blogspot.com/),
then on [wordpress](https://easythereentropy.wordpress.com/). Now I host this
blog on [github](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/).

The following books/lectures (and their authors!) have had an outsized influence on my life (in order):

- [The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind] by Julian
  Jaynes
- [Out of Your Mind: Essential Listening from the Alan Watts Audio Archives] by
  Alan Watts
- [Jitterbug Perfume] by Tom Robbins
- [The Rainbow and the Worm: The Physics of Organisms] by Mae Wan Ho
- [Creating Wealth: Growing Local Economies with Local Currencies] by Gwendolyn
  Hallsmith and Bernard Lietaer

Some other major early influences include:

- Philosophy: [Robert Anton Wilson], [Terrence McKenna], [Neal Cassady].
- Psychology and Religion: [Mircea Eliade] \(I've read most of his books), [Carl Jung], 
the book [Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief] 
- Media and Technology: [Marshall McLuhan], [Marcel Danesi], [Buckminster
  Fuller]
- Economics: [E.F. Schumacher], [Jane Jacobs], [Elinor Ostrom], [Nassim Taleb], [Friedrich Hayek].

These days I'm studying monetary economics, guided largely by the work of 
[Perry Mehrling] and [George Selgin], though my main influences are the
"localists" listed above.


Some quotes I'm fond of:

---
> "There is nothing in a caterpillar that tells you it's going to be a butterfly."

> *- Buckminster Fuller*

---

> "There are no passengers on spaceship earth. We are all crew."

> *- Marshall McLuhan*

---

> "Human beings were invented by water as a device for transporting itself from
one place to another."

> *- Tom Robbins*

---

> “There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the
Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be
replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. 
>
> There is another theory which states that this has already happened.”

> *- Douglas Adams*

The profile picture is a super-resolution image of actin filaments in a kidney
cell (*Xu et al. Nature Methods 9: 185-188 (2012)*). I believe that 
cellular biophysical mechanics (cytoskeleton, extra-cellular matrix, collagen networks,
etc.) are perhaps more fundamental to understanding multi-cellular organisms than sequences of DNA.
Your DNA wouldn't even be able to replicate itself were it not for the
[microtubules].
