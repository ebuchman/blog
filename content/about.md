I work in software, research, education, and the garden.

The following more or less sum me up:

---
> "There is nothing in a caterpillar that tells you it's going to be a butterfly."

> *- Buckminster Fuller*

---

> "There are no passengers on spaceship earth. We are all crew."

> *- Marshall McLuhan*

---

> "Human beings were invented by water as a device for transporting itself from
one place to another."

> *- Tom Robbins*

---

> “There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the
Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be
replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. 
>
> There is another theory which states that this has already happened.”

> *- Douglas Adams*
