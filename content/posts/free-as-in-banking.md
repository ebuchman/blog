## Money is the Killer App

Cryptocurrencies are a monetary revolution. 
They transform money from the liabilities of unaccountable banks into the assets of transparent distributed network protocols.
Instead of monetizing debt, they allow us to monetize other social and cultural
values. They provide orders of magnitude reduction in the transaction costs of 
improved political economic mechanisms, enabling explosive experimentation in
monetary institutions. 

Monetary institutions today are deeply ill - they are structural producers of
inequality and are riddled with poorly understood systemic risk. Moral hazard
abounds. But monetary institutions are load bearing foundations of modern society. 
To disrupt them too rapidly could lead to widespread instability, even financial
collapse. Not that they're doing the best job of avoiding such instability
themselves. But if we're going to get serious about the monetary revolution
afoot, we would do well to study the history and structure of monetary
institutions. This post is a brief tour of the history of central banking.

TODO: ?
In some sense, they never really recovered from the first World War.
Moral Hazard. Systemic Risk. deeply unsustainable. Cite ozurks paper.
Cryptocurrencies as our best shot.


## The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street

Banking in the form of making loans and holding deposits is an ancient practice.
But a series of innovations, largely from the Netherlands, materialized in
the 17th century to transform banking from a game of largely hedged finance (to use
Hyman Minksy's terms), to one increasingly of speculative and ponzi finance.
In the hands of national governments, these innovations emerged as central
banks.

The most notable central bank is the Bank of England. Though it wouldn't
formally become what we now know as a central bank until the 19th century, 
the Bank of England was founded in the 1690s to support HM government in
financing war with France. The credit of the government was so poor (TODO WHY?
defaulted recently? lost the war? ) that it could not raise the funds ... The
Bank of England was incorporated as TODO and given the right to issue bank notes
... TODO

Within 2 years, the government had to allow the bank to suspend specie payments.
TODO cycles of crashes. 

TODO Tension between financing government and exerting discipline.
Wooing the Old Lady.

TODO 19th century. Bagehot. Compare to today 

## Above the Law

John Law. Bank of France

France calls bullshit on the English in the 20th century

## Hamilton Wildcats 


Continental currency issued to fund the war. Inflation. Lost 99% of value.
Hamilton - founding father, first secretary of the treasury
1st bank - clean up the war debt mess. 
Restrictions. Couldnt buy govt bonds. 20 year charter. wasnt renwed. 1791-1811
2nd bank. 5 years later. 20 year charter again. Lost recharter in the bank war
to Andrew Jackson.
Supporters - stabilizing, smooth prices, extend credit, standard currency,
manage inflation by regulating lending at state banks
Anti - corruption. Favored merchants and speculators at expense of farmers and
artisans
Collapse of second bank probably led to panic of 1837
Wildcat banking 1836-1863. State law. No federal regulation. Backed by state
bonds. Often junk. Led to many bank failures.
Free banking but not really - banks couldnt branch, they had to get state
charters, and they had to hold shitty state bonds
Notes denominated in dollars but often traded at discount, especially farther
from issuing banks headquarters

## Greenback Boogie

Original money printr go brrrr 
1864
Title from a letter from the secretary of war after they lost the Battle of Bull
Run …
Lincoln - “all this reminds me of a most capital joke”
Salmon P Chase - “give me more greenbacks”
Legal tender act. To fund the civil war. Greenbacks. $450M. Backed by credit of
the US gov. To be redeemed some point in the future
National Bank Act. single national currency, national bank charter system, and
raise money for the war. 
Notes had to be secured by government securities
system of national banks and the Office of Comptroller of the Currency. Taxed
state notes, pushing them out of circulation
Reserve requirements and lack of branching led to pyramiding of reserves in NY
Correspondant banking super lucrative in NY. more so than commercial.
No branching: banks couldnt diversify, made coordination difficult
Seasonal demand in currency. Harvest time. Led to crises - 1873, 1884, 1890,
1893, 1907. 
These crises were a US thing (!)


## Free Banking

Dozens of banks, 1000s of branch offices

## Fed Up on Jekyll Island

Panic of 1907
Prior, asset backed idea had wide acceptance, but never passed politically (bad
for nY)
Established a commission to study the 1907 panic and figure out what happened
chaired senate finance committee
Facade for Aldrich’s agenda. Preserve NY dominance 
Ppl calling for commodity currency, calling for branch banking. Canada as a
model 
Aldrich plan - ignored all that. Fed more effective in securing NY hedgemony
than securing financial stability
Jekyll island. NY bankers worried about smaller banks sudden calls for cash.
Others assumed, based on studying eg. German central bank, the US currency was
inelastic because it lacked one
Aldrich shifted convo from whether there should be a central bank to what it
should look like
Chewing gum elasticity rather than rubber band
Federal reserve. Allegedly decentralized. But really NY dominates

and put forward a responsible trajectory to guide us from the current regime to 
highly unsustainable regime of central banking and international finance to a more sustainable 


Bitcoin as an international store of value (a digital gold) and Ether as an
international fuel of commerce (a digital oil) are early manifestations of this
new found monetary power.

DeFi is the manifestation of this 

Money is a social binding agent. It transforms the valence of strangers from hostile to cooperative.
Religion largely served this role in the past - the word religion even derives
from "to bind".

It's come to replace religion as the dominant 



Of course, the cryptocurrency world is at present highly divorced from reality.
While swirling with transformative potential, it's used for very little real world commerce
and is driven almost entirely by speculation. The current obsession with DeFi is 

It's no wonder the industry has
become obsessed with financial applications in the form of DeFi, 






For most of the last decade I've had nothing but contempt for banking and
finance. I had never studied them the way I studied, say, neuroscience or
consensus algorithms, but I had a general understanding that there was something
largely unsound and unfair about the way the global financial system was
structured.

Notes

Finance is unsound.

Crypto is the best chance we have.

Money is the Killer App - Our goal with this technology must be to evolve a more
sound and sustainable international financial regime that bridges the gap from
local to global money and back.

Ethereum. Renewed political economics.
MakerDAO. Decentral Bank. Etc.

Cosmos. Localism. Social and technical scalability.

Fatalism around money. But it can change. Need to understand the institutional history.

Economy vs Ecology

Invisible hand that cooked Adam smiths dinner

Question of issuance. Who to issue to.

## Old Lady of Threadneedle Street

Much of the history of central banking revolves around the Bank of England.
While technically not the first central bank (the Riksbank of Sweden gets that
honour), the Bank of England dominated international finance until well into the 20th century and 
served as a model for central banks around the world.

The Bank of England came to be known as the Old Lady of Threadneedle St,
epitomized by this cartoon .
prime minister raiding old ladies pockets for gold. wearing a gown made of paper
money.
tension between govt needing to raid central bank.

origin of BoE. financing war. late 1600s, england devastated by war with france.
wanted to build a navy. but credit was poor, so no one would lend it money. so
commissioned a bank to raise money.

1800s, lender of last resort formalized by Bagehot.
responsible articulation of central bank's role.
lend freely at h...
good way to backstop bankruns.
compare to today. low interest, insolvent firms, shit collateral.
