*This is not investment advice*

For years I've felt that the vast majority of publicly available securities
represent fundamentally socially irresponsible behaviour (ie. global military industrial financial capitalism), 
and I didn't really want anything to do with them. 
This is of course a big part of what led me, and so many others, to cryptocurrencies,
which, despite a proliferation of degenerate behaviour among projects and
participants, appear to be technology's best bet on fighting global sources of
oppression and exploitation.
But as the value of the dollar continues to plunge, I've been wondering more about what 
a socially responsible, or at least, less socially iresponsible portfolio of public securities might look like.

The art and science of [Socially Responsible Investing][SRI] seems to be dominated
by ["ESG"][ESG], an amorphous and non-standardized rating system that scores
corporations on Environmental, Social, and Governance components of their business.
The popularity of ESG-based portfolios is surging. But "ESG" hardly 
begins to capture the ethical dimensions of modern capitalism,
and makes a mockery of what a sustainable global economic system would actually look like. 
There are now dozens of ESG ratings agencies and an ever expanding market of ESG mutual funds and ETFs.
If you search for "ESG ETF", you will probably get a lot of "iShares" and
"MSCI". iShares are the ETFs provided by [Black Rock][BlackRock], the world's largest asset
manager and ETF provider, and MSCI runs one of the largest ESG ratings agencies.

Let's look at the holdings of some of these ETFs in different jurisdictions. 

In the US, the [iShares ESG ETF][iShares US] and the 
[Vanguard ESG ETF][Vanguard US] (Vanguard is second only to Black Rock)
are dominated, unsurprisingly, by big tech. 
Of the big five FAAMG, Apple seems to be the most socially responsible,
followed by Microsoft, and they top both ETFs. Vanguard then follows with
Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, while iShares follows with Alphabet and Facebook,
but doesn't include Amazon at all.

It's hard to imagine companies more threatening to the social fabric of sustainable economic
societies than Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Google and Facebook are actively 
enabling, if not encouraging, psychological warfare that is devastating the mental 
health of younger generations and obliterating the foundations of democracy.
Facebook,  especially, is engaged in a perverse and insiduous evil, a form of
digital and psychological colonialism the moral reprehensibility of which may
not have been seen since the Dutch East India Company. And then there's Amazon,
slowly and steadily consuming the entire global supply chain, all but
extinguishing local commerce. The anti-competitiveness of Amazon is the stuff of legend.

Of course, these tech giants are leading the charge on all
kinds of amazing energy efficient computing initiatives, and per bit are
probably far more environmentally sustainable than smaller companies. But the
business models themselves are fundamentally socially irresponsible. 
The idea that Google, Facebook, or Amazon could play any significant role in an ethically invested
portfolio seems abhorrent to me.

In Canada, [ESG
ETFs](https://www.blackrock.com/ca/investors/en/products/307298/ishares-esg-aware-msci-canada-index-etf-fund) 
are dominated by Canadian financial institutions (Canada's big banks). 
Modern financial institutions are engaged in a massive pyramid scheme that 
is propagating wage and debt slavery at unprecedented levels, 
mortgaging our collective future for a quick buck and inflating a
fundamentally unsustainable financial system. 
Yes, this is more true in the US than elsewhere, and Canadian banks have an
alleged soundness that is the envy of many nations. But no matter how many trees
they plant or stakeholders they consult, at the scale they operate (ie.
nationally or internationally, with billions of dollars), their business
models are fundamentally exploitative. 

For years, my grandfather, a chartered accountant who worked until he passed away at 89,
tried to convince me to buy Canadian bank stocks.
As far as he could tell, going all in on the 5 Canadian banks and Bell Canada
was the most responsible thing to do. I tried and
failed to explain to him that I felt the same way about the banks as he might feel about
the tobacco companies, which he didn't like much, and so I couldn't buy them. 
Of course I was also trying to get him to buy Bitcoin, which he never
accomplished. If he was going to speculate, he prefered weed stocks. 
We bonded over our respective account managers advising us to avoid both. 
My zaidy passed away this fall; I bought all 5 Canadian banks in his memory.

Notably, Shopify got big enough this year to rise to the top of that iShares Canada ESG ETF.
Shopify probably serves as a very strong socially responsible counterpoint to Amazon.
Of course, it is categorized as tech, but it's also [becoming a
dominant financial institution](https://www.shopify.ca/capital), playing a very different game than the banks. 
This is a really important development, and Canadian tech is poised to usher 
in a new and more responsible age of internet capitalism.

In Europe, where the culture and regulatory regime lean much more socialist than
North America, ESG capital markets are surging. The European [ESG ETFs][iShares
Europe] are more
diversified across sectors like tech (ASML, SAP), industrial manufacturing (Siemens), 
health care (Roche, Novartis), and consumer goods (LVMH, Loreal, Nestle, Unilever). 
Unlike the companies that dominate North American ETFs, 
the European companies tend to manufacture real goods that aren't
necessarily undermining the fabric of society. Or at least if they are, it's a
Swiss chemist at a Novartis subsidiary inventing LSD.

That said, many of the European companies have their own checkered history of exploitation
detailed on their Wikipedia pages.
Nestle, which tops the iShares ETF, seems particularly bad in its exploitation of water resources,
proliferation of plastic, and its continued use of child slave labour (!).
But some, like ASML, LVMH, and Roche, seem to have relatively
clean records (that is, if you're into micro-processors, luxury goods, and pharmaceuticals), 
and others, like Loreal and Unilever, seem to be making credible
commitments to clean up their act (if you're okay with animal testing *TODO*
and sugar). It's promising, but these are all still massive companies,
and it seems no matter what, with multi-nationals, you're going to have to pick
your poison.

Then there's the Asian ESG ETFs, like the [iShares emerging markets one][iShares
Asia], which is almost 50% Chinese companies, dominated by giants Alibaba and
Tencent. I can't pretend to understand Chinese capitalism, but it seems like the large
companies are in general  arms of the Chinese government *TODO*, which is currently
committing genocide of the Uyghur in [Xinjiang concentration camps][Uyghur]. It's
probably not a good time to support Chinese conglomerates. 
Other Asian ETFs, and some non-US ETFs (primarily Europe + Asia), otherwise give
a lot of weight to Korea (Samsung), Japan (Toyota, Sony), and Taiwan (Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing). Korean and Japanese
companies are probably a lot more like European companies, but with less labour protections.
TSMC seems like a special case, on the one hand because it seems to have a
reasonably clean record, on the other because, as a counterpoint to
China, it seems like a good time to be supporting Taiwan.

As for Africa, the ETFs and capital markets in general are much less mature.
iShares has a [South African ESG ETF][iShares SA], which is 20% Naspers,
Africa's biggest public company, who also owns ~30% of Tencent.

The ETFs we've looked at so far prioritize large corporations, and we only
looked at a very small sample - some are certainly better than others, though the main iShares/MSCI 
funds tend to be representive. You might say
these ETFs select from the largest companies, minimizing for bad behaviour (a
lot of ESG seems to be about minimizing bad behaviour). But
there's also a number of ETFs striving to maximize good behaviour by
focusing on certain sectors and smaller companies. This might qualify more as
"impact investing" than "socially responsible investing". Many of these are focused in
the energy sector, with names like 
"Low Carbon Energy", 
"Solar", and 
"Clean Energy". 
Other are more general than energy, with names like 
"Environmental Leaders", 
"Positive Change", and
"Sustainable Growth".
Perhaps not surprisingly, Tesla plays a big role in a lot of them.
In any case, by striving for a selection that maximizes good behaviour, 
these ETFs seem to be a lot more socially responsible than the more popular ESG ETFs that
primarily minimize bad behaviour. But of course, given these companies tend to
be smaller and less diversified, the risk/reward trade off is different as well.

WealthSimple rolled out their own [socially responsible portfolio][WealthSimple portfolio], 
which includes a variety of government bonds, plus a North American and a Developed Markets ETF. You can
probably imagine I'm not a fan of the way governments finance belligerent
spending through bonds, so I won't talk about them at all here. WealthSimple
released a great [summary of its approach][WealthSimple Summary]. Let's look at the [North
American ETF they use][WealthSimple ETF]. It contains all of FAAMG
(though only about ~0.4% of each). The biggest allocation (~5%) is to Hydro One,
the Ontario electrical utility which underwent a controversial privatization
process over the last 5 years as the province sold off its controlling stake.
The next top companies in the ETF (~3% each) are 
Vulcan Materials (American construction materials), 
Agnico-Eagle Mines (Canadian gold producer), and
Cameco Corp (the world's largest uranium company, based in Canada), which are interesting selections for sure.

Extensive due diligence on companies and ETFs is a lot of work,
and comprehensive analysis of socially responsible behaviour is an ethical minefield. 
Beyond hand picking some set of companies that feel good, if you want the
diversification of an ETF, it's probably best to seek
out funds from issuers that themselves seem more trustworthy to make socially
responsible selections. From this perspective, some that have stood out to me
include a number of Canadian entities like Desjardins (a co-operative of credit unions),
NEI (specializes in responsible investing), and
Waratah (alternative asset management firm that goes long and short based on its
own ESG ratings). Sometimes the holdings for particular funds can be harder
to find, so of course, do your own research, and if you discover other interesting issuers
and funds, please let me know - you can find me

Besides ESG ratings and ETFs, another possible approach to socially responsible investing is
to look for public B Corps, or "Benefit Corporations". ["Benefit Corporation"][Benefit Corp] is a legal
designation for corporations in the US which overrides traditional "shareholder capitalism"
with a much more socially responsible "stakeholder capitalism". Incorporating as a Benefit Corporation is a
legitimate alternative to the more traditional "Delaware C Corp" of most tech companies,
as it gives legal rights to stakeholders beyond those that own shares (including
employees, customers, suppliers, the environment, etc.).
Benefit Corporations were popularized by [B Labs][BLabs], an American non-profit 
that issues ["B Corp" certificates][BCorp] to corporations that uphold rigorous standards
of responsible corporate behaviour. B Labs offers its certificates
internationally, and there are currently over 3000 certified B Corps. However,
the vast majority of them are private companies. B Labs doesn't seem to publish
a canonical list of those that are public (and thus accessible to retail
investors), but [@jackiebrownTO](https://twitter.com/JackieBrownTO) helped me compile some by cross-checking
a list of B Corps against a list of NASDAQ companies. This turned up
Natura,
Silver Chef Group,
Australian Ethical,
Amalgamated Bank,
VivoPower International,
O-Bank,
Arowana, all of which are public B-Corps. Most of these companies are pretty small.
But there are also a number of large companies that have been buying up B Corps, 
and operating them as subsidiaries. These include 
Unilever,
Danone, and
P&G. Etsy used to be a B Corp, but it couldn't manage to maintain its
certifcation when it went public, which is quite a shame. *TODO*

At some level, purchasing goods and services from a company is a form of
investment, and should also be considered through a socially responsible lens, 
though it usually doesn't equate to ownership of a public security.
This might imply that you should invest in companies whose products and services 
you use, or at least those you don't feel coerced to use. I've managed to stop
using all Facebook products (and would encourage you to try as well), 
and I rarely if ever buy from Amazon, though it's
pretty hard to avoid AWS, or to escape from GSuite. 
Being in tech, it's hard to not use an iPhone and Macbook; planned obsolescence and port shenanigans aside, at least Apple stands out for
its protection of privacy rights and a business model that isn't based on hijacking your nervous system. 
Microsoft also seems to be getting better (and they own Github now, for better or for worse), but they're still contracting with ICE.  
Then there are Jack's companies - I don't use Square, but I do kind of
love Twitter. Obviously it has a lot of issues around toxic cesspools and harassment, 
but it's also kind of magical.

A big part of the problem with socially responsible investment is the very restriction to
public securities. By the time a company goes public, almost by definition,
it has had to sacrifice quite substantially. The large public markets, underwritten by investment banks,
beseiged by high frequency traders and other extractive intermediaries, are to a
significant extent socially irresponsible in and of themselves. Securities laws restricting investment
in smaller companies is perhaps one of the most powerful wedges exacerbating
wealth inequality and inhibiting capital formation in more sustainable and
ethical businesses. Fortunately, there is a small but growing movement to relax securities
regulations and make investing in smaller and more local companies much more
accessible, spawning platforms like the [SVX][SVX] and [FrontFundr][FrontFundr] in Canada, which list
a variety of more socially responsible companies. 
Cryptocurrencies will continue to apply pressure here.

There's also been growing popularity in "Community Bonds", issued by local organizations to members of their community to raise money for new
projects or other growth. Ontario has even relaxed securities laws specifically
for Renewable Energy Cooperatives, leading to a number of "Solar Bond"
offerings. I've found these community bonds actually tend to sell out pretty fast, 
and I've missed a lot of local offerings that I would have liked to support, like the
[CSI Community Bond][CSI] and the [Zooshare Bond][Zooshare]. Others I did buy
into include the [42 Carden Community Bond][] and the [Fair Finance Fund][]. 
One challenge with these kinds of bonds is that they don't necessarily qualify for
registered savings accounts (eg. RRSP/TFSA in Canada), and if they do, it can be
a pain in the ass to get your bank to process them. Hopefully this eases
significantly in the near future but in the meantime, there are some trust
companies, like Compushare and Pacific Trust that specialize in holding such alternative
securities in registered accounts. Of course, this is all still debt-based
financing, but it's a start.

In the end, this a pretty complex problem. And folks like Garadaras *TODO* levy amazing
critiques at the very notion that socially responsible or impact investing is
even possible in the context of our global financial system. What we need,
obviously, is to reform our political economic institutions. Hence my
overwhelming preference for smaller and more local investments, though the
securities regulators make this prohibitive for most. In general, I'd say the
best you can do is follow some heuristics: small is better, US and China are worse, 
find fund managers you trust, seek out more rigorous certifications like B Corps, 
and most of all, look for the unique alternative local opportunites that might be available
within your community.
