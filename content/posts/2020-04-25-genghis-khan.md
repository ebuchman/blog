## International Empires

The story of human civilization begins around 10k years ago
in the dawn of agricultural societies, in a new relationship between humans and land. 
Agriculture transformed the nature of land from external environment
into direct extension of the human body and society;
from something to contend with into something to protect. 

The story is often told, [quite wonderfully](#video-empires), in maps; the changing borders
of unified claims on land in the form of empires that ebb and flow across 
the rugged surface of the Earth over the last few thousand years. 
As an empire evolves physically, transforming swaths of land from "them" to "us", 
it accelerates the flow of information between its internal regions and catalyzes the evolution of culture.

Something notable happens around 2500 years ago: a large number of smaller sovereignties
in Europe, Africa, and Asia consolidate into one international entity - the Achaemenid Empire, the first of its kind.
Alexander the Great often gets credit for his efforts and successes in uniting the world a few hundred years
later, but the Persians had already done most of the work. Alexander was just the Macedonian megalomaniac 
who showed up and lifted it from them, spreading the Greek revolution in technology and values into the East.

Within a few hundred years of Alexander's death, the Silk Road would officially open,
but the East and West would cease to be united by a common empire for another thousand years.
If Alexendar brought a few hundred years of early European cultural evolution to the East, it wasn't until
the empire of Genghis Khan, the Modest Mongolian, that a *millenium* of Chinese cultural evolution was brought back West,
effectively ending the Middle Ages and laying the foundation for the Enlightenment in Europe.

## Genghis Khan

Genghis Khan often gets a bad rap - a ruthless brute, the archetypical barbarian.
But the truth seems to be somewhat the opposite; while he was absolutely lethal in battle, 
he was far more humane, progressive, and clever than any of his contemporaries.
He ran a meritocracy with a strict code of ethics 
that applied to him as well as it did to anyone else. His power was checked by elections.
He didn't enslave, he assimilated. He distributed wealth fairly. 
He liberated women. He was driven to upend and flatten the hierarchies of power, of aristocracy
and inequality, to promote free trade and freedom of religion, to elevate skill
over lineage. But to do so, he would have to become a merciless warrior, leading a merciless
warrior nation; to execute swiftly and with lethal effectiveness; to terrify the world. 

Genghis Khan, whose actual name is Tem√ºjin, was raised in the school of hard knocks. 
While Alexander embodied Western privilege as the son of a king and student of Aristotle,
Temujin was born in the middle of the 12th century into a low status clan in a society of small,
warring, nomadic Mongol tribes; he had to continuously fight for his life. 

Temujin's father kidnapped his mother from another clan.
An outsider from the outset, he was born clutching a blood clot, which his mother took to be an immense omen.
His father was poisoned to death and his family was abandoned by his father's tribe.
Sibling rivalry would cause him to murder his older half-brother.
His young wife was kidnapped and raped. An old friend of his father's,
who served as his own mentor and guardian, tried to have him killed. His best friend became his most bitter enemy.

Cast amidst this rugged upringing was Temujin's humble ambition to put an end to the cycles of violence,
of attack and counter attack, to unite the warring Mongol tribes. 
The story of how a nomadic, pre-civilized warrior went on to establish 
the largest empire in history is an astounding one, told in detail in Jack
Weatherford's [Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World](#genghis-book).
Much of civilization's history is interjected with invasions by pre-civilized,
nomadic, "barbarian" tribes - the early Hebrews in Israel; the Germanic tribes and the Huns in Rome; 
the Five Barbarians in China; the Turkish conquests. But the Mongol Invasions and the resulting Mongol Peace
were unprecedented in scope.

## The Mongolian Nation

Temujin's rise to power, his weaving of diverse Turko-Mongolic tribes into a unified peoples and ultimately
an empire, was marked by his implementation of fundamentally progressive policy changes
to reduce internal conflict in the increasingly larger groups he ruled over. 

First, as he become khan (chief) of his own minor group, the Mongols, in his
late 20s, he elevated loyalty and merit above kinship, appointing important positions 
based and competency and loyalty, abolishing aristocracy and enabling anyone to rise 
through the ranks.

Second, as he expanded his territory to include small neighbouring Turko-Mongolian tribes in his late 30s, 
he elevated assimilation over slavery or desertion, slaying the aristocracy and marrying 
the remaining people throughout households in his own clan, 
even adopting some of them into his own family as siblings to be raised by his mother. 

Third, as he worked to assimilate the much larger neighbouring Tatars in his
early 40s, he pursued the orderly collection and redistribution of the spoils of war 
over chaotic and haphazard looting. This allowed for a more complete victory over defeated
soldiers before looting began, preventing escape and later counter attacks.
It also enabled loot to be distributed meritocratically,
including fair allocations for widows and children of killed soldiers. 

Fourth, to fully integrate the thousands of Tatars, he radically reorganized the structure of
the army and tribe beyond kinship ties by randomly assigning warriors into squads of 10 that were ordered to live
and fight as brothers. He organized 10 squads into companies, 10 companies into battallions, and 10 battalions 
into a *tumen*, a small army of 10,000, the leader of which he would personally appoint. 
Thus the modular structure of the army came to transform the nature and life of the tribe by aligning all service and relationships along these lines.

Taken together, these reforms would have the effect of dismantling aristocracy,
maintaining loyalty, and improving integration of the different tribes.
At this point, he had succeeded in abolishing class distinction - his followers were now one united people:
the People of the Felt Walls, in homage to the material that make up their ephemeral nomadic homes.

Nearly 2000 years earlier, Cleisthenes implemented a similar reform in Greece,
allocating people into units of 10 to cut through the tribal rivalries of the time and lay
the foundation for Athenian citizenship and democracy.
While there's no reason to believe Temujin was directly aware of these efforts, the parallels are striking.

By his mid 40s, after final showdowns with powerful men from his past who ruled
the remaining large tribes in the Mongolian plateau, Temujin would be elevated to the status of Great Ruler 
of the newly formed Great Mongol Nation of over a million people and around 15-20 million animals 
distributed across the Mongolian steppe. His Mongolian title was Chinggis Khan, 
Khan of the people of the strong, fearless, wolf. In Persian, it would be Genghis Khan.

To bring further order to his newly formed nation, and to reduce dissent
within, Genghis Khan introduced his Great Law. Unlike his contemparies across Eurasia, 
who ruled above the law and according to the will of God, 
the Great Law was a force of meritocracy and applied to rulers, including himself, as well as anyone else.
He adopted a writing system, the first among the Mongol people, to help record and administer the law,
and established a highly efficient public postal service that would come to rank as highly as the military itself.
  
Via the Great Law, among the Mongol Nation,Genghis Khan banned the kidnapping of women and their sale into marriage;
he banned the abduction or enslavement of other Mongols and the stealing of
animals; he implemented a lost and found system; he forbade hunting during
reproductive seasons; he implemented complete and 
total religious freedom, and nurtured a diverse mix of shaminist, Christian,
Muslim, and Buddhist religions; he exempted religious leaders and other
professionals - like doctors, lawyers, teachers, and scholars - from taxes
and public service.

All of this was in stark contrast to his supposedly more civilized
contemporaries in Europe, Persia, and East Asia, who he would turn his
attention to next.

## Mongolian Conquests

The Mongolian army was lethal, and unlike anything the civilized peoples of the
world has seen before. Unlike the frail peasant armies of cities, the Mongol
diet was rich in wholesome protein and fat. They could survive entirely off dried 
meat and dairy, and hunt for food as necessary, avoiding the need to carry a large food supply chain or
to cook meals. They could also more easily fast for a day or two. The recursive
structure of their army made them highly fluid - more like a set
of concentric circles than a hierarchy of units. They spread out over vast distances,
and communicated extremely efficiently, using a mix of silent signals and song. 

As a smaller, leaner attack force, the Mongols became masters of 
psychological warfare, employing trickery, deception, confusion, and propoganda 
wherever possible to reduce the amount of actual fighting they had to do,
and to leverage their enemies against themselves. They would spread rumours to ignite infighting; 
pretend to retreat and then attack during premature victory celebrations; 
stampede peasants out of the fields towards the city to jam supply routes. They
made extensive use of paper to spread terrifying rumours of how large and
ruthless their army was. Their notoriety today is likely much more
a result of their own trumped up tales than it is of their actual casualties.

The Mongolian conquests of the world began with the cities of Northern
China, who had traditionally dominated over the warring tribes of the steppe.
Cities were offered the opportunity to simply surrender and pay tribute. If they refused,
they would quickly lose in war. If they agreed, but then betrayed him, they
would be anihilated. It was here the Mongolians perfected the conquering of cities 
and adopted the Chinese siege technology and gunpowder weapons. Rather than
carry such machines along with them, conquered professionals were incorporated across the army 
into a distributed engineering corps that could assemble the machines as needed from local materials.

Having expanded his empire east to modern-day Beijing, and having secured
access to Chinese goods and technology, Genghis Khan sought to engage in peaceful trade with others, 
especially the Islamic Persian societies to the south west. But when he sent
peaceful envoys to the neighbouring Khwarizm Empire to initiate commercial relationships, 
his envoys were murdered and maimed. Now in his late 50s, Genghis Khan responded with ferocity, 
annihilating the perpetrators, and incorporating
virtually all of Persia into his empire over just a couple years. Many cities
surrendered or fell within days or weeks. While overall reports of direct casualties during these conquests 
are likely absurd, having been inflated by Mongol propoganda, entire cities were massacred or razed
to the ground during this time. 

Genghis Khan returned to Mongolia, to wage more war against other Northern
Chinese states that had betrayed or wronged him. He would ultimately die 
there in his mid 60s. At this point his empire stretched from North Eastern China all
the way across the Eurasian steppe to the Caspian Sea and Persia.

Genghis Khan's sons and grandsons would go on to expand the empire, to cover all
of China, southern and western Russia, the Caucasus and eastern Europe, and
Mesopotamia. The only thing that seemed capable of stopping the advance of the Mongolian army
was heat and humidity, which weakened their bows and caused them and their
horses to struggle and fall ill. Hence the topography and climate of Eurasia
would come to mark the southern and western boundaries of the empire, preventing it from expanding
into South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Mediteranian, and the rest of Europe.

## Mongolian Legacy

Under their reign, the Silk Road would be revitalized and the
technology and people of the regions would mix prosperously in the geat Pax
Mongolica, the Mongolian Peace.
