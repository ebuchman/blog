## International Empires

The story of human civilization begins around 10k years ago
in the dawn of agricultural societies, in a new relationship between humans and land. 
Agriculture transformed the nature of land from external environment
into direct extension of the human body and society;
from something to contend with into something to protect. 

The story is often told, [quite wonderfully](#video-empires), in maps; the changing borders
of unified claims on land in the form of empires that ebb and flow across 
the rugged surface of the Earth over the last few thousand years. 
As an empire evolves physically, transforming swaths of land from "them" to "us", 
it accelerates the flow of information between its internal regions and catalyzes the evolution of culture.

Something notable happens around 2500 years ago: a large number of smaller sovereignties
in Europe, Africa, and Asia consolidate into one international entity - the Achaemenid Empire, the first of its kind.
Alexander the Great often gets credit for his efforts and successes in uniting the world a few hundred years
later, but really the Persians had already done the work. Alexander was just the Macedonian megalomaniac 
who showed up and lifted it from them, spreading the Greek revolution in technology and values into the East.

Within a few hundred years of Alexander's death, the Silk Road would officially open,
but the East and West would cease to be united by a common empire for another thousand years.
If Alexendar brought a few hundred years of early European cultural evolution to the East, it wasn't until
the empire of Genghis Khan, that modest Mongolian, that a millenium of Chinese cultural evolution was brought back West,
effectively ending the Middle Ages and laying the foundation for the Enlightenment in Europe.

## Genghis Khan

Genghis Khan often gets a bad rap - a ruthless brute, the archertypical barbarian.
But the truth seems to be nearly the opposite - that he was far more humane, progressive,
and intelligent than any of his contemporaries. He ran a meritocracy with a strict code of ethics 
that applied to him as well as it did to anyone else. His power was checked by elections.
He didn't enslave, he assimilated. He distributed wealth fairly. 
He liberated women. He was driven to upend and flatten the hierarchies of power, of aristocracy
and inequality. To put an end to the cycles of violence, of attack and counter attack, that dominated the fabric 
of human societies. But to do so, he would have to become a merciless warrior, leading a merciless
warrior nation; to execute swiftly and with ruthless effectiveness; to terrify the world. 
Despite these humble humanitarian aspirations, casualties of the Mongolian empire would number in the millions. 
TODO: caveat the number ?

Genghis Khan, whose actual name is Tem√ºjin, was raised in the school of hard knocks. 
While Alexander embodied Western privilege as the son of a king and student of Aristotle,
Temujin was born in the middle of the 12th century into a low status band in a society of small 
warring nomadic Mongol tribes; he had to continuously fight for his life. 

Temujin's father kidnapped his mother from another clan.
An outsider from the outset, he was born clutching a blood clot, which his mother took to be an immense omen.
His father was poisoned to death and his family was abandoned by his father's tribe.
Sibling rivalry would cause him to murder his older half-brother.
His young wife was kidnapped and raped. An old friend of his father's,
who served as his own mentor and guardian, tried to have him killed. His best friend became his most bitter enemy.

Cast amidst this rugged upringing was Temujin's humble ambition to put an end to the cycles of violence,
to unite the warring Mongol tribes. The story of how a nomadic, pre-civilized warrior went on to establish 
the largest empire in history is an astounding one. 
Much of civilization's history is interjected with invasions by pre-civilized
"barbarian" tribes - the early Hebrews in Israel; the Germanic tribes and the Huns in Rome; 
the Five Barbarians in China; the Turkish conquests. But the Mongol invasions are unprecedented in scope.

## Cultural Innovations

Temujin's rise to power in weaving the diverse Mongolian tribes into a unified peoples and ultimately
an empire was marked by his implementation of fundamentally progressive policy changes in 
the increasingly larger groups he ruled over. Such policies were designed to reduce internal conflict, and
were in stark contrast to more abhorent manifestations of power both in the local traditions and 
in kingdoms across the world.

First, once he became khan, or chief, of a minor group, he elevated loyalty and merit above kinship, 
abolishing aristocracy and enabling anyone to rise through the ranks by demonstrating themselves through their 
competency or their loyalty. This would have a significant impact in maintaining the loyalty of his followers over 
the decades and in building a highly competent and effective tribe and army.

Second, as he expanded his territory, he elevated assimilation over slavery. Rather than enslaving the peoples
of a conquered region, he would slay their aristocracy and marry the remaining people throughout households
in his own clan. He would even adopt some of them into his own family, as siblings to be raised by his mother.
This had the dual effect of both chilling the old aristocracy and increasing the likelihood that conquered people's
would remain loyal to him as they came to be genuine members of his tribe.

Third, as he expanded further, he elevated the orderly collection and redistribution of the spoils of war 
over chaotic looting. Typically, once it was clear an invasion was a success, attackers would begin
haphazardly looting the spoils for themselves while the defeated soldiers fled and escaped. To prevent
such soliders from returning to counter attack, and to improve the management and distribution of loot,
the young khan commanded a more complete victory before any loot could be collected. Collection was 
then done in an orderly fashion and redistributed meritocratically the way meat was distributed after a hunt, including
fair allocations for widows and children of killed soldiers. This further disempowered aristocratic lineages
and increased the loyalty of his followers, especially the poor and the soldiers, who knew they and their 
families would be looked after.

At this point the rising khan had conquerued and assimilated tribes of hundreds, but as he conquered the neighbouring Tatars,
which consisted of thousands, he needed more drastic measures. So with permission from his warriors, he murdered
all tall Tartar males and doubled down on assimilating the rest of the peoples, this time by even marrying some of them
himself. Though they were once a distinct ethnocultural group from the Mongols, so many Tatars
were assimilated that the Tatar name became synonymous with Mongol.

In order to truly merge these two large groups of Tatars and Mongols, he radically reorganized the structure of
the army and tribe beyond kinship ties by randomly assigning warriors into squads of 10 that were ordered to live
and fight as brothers. He organized 10 squads into companies, 10 companies into battallions, and 10 battalions 
into a *tumen*, a small army of 10,000. He would personally appoint the leader of each tumen. Thus the modular 
structure of the army came to transform the nature and life of the tribe by aligning all service and relationships
along these lines. At this point, he had succeeded in abolishing class distinction - his followers were now one united people:
the People of the Felt Walls, in homage to the material that make up their ephemeral nomadic homes.

Nearly 2000 years earlier, Cleisthenes implemented a similar reform in Greece,
allocating people into units of 10 to cut through the tribal rivalries of the time and lay
the foundation for Athenian citizenship and democracy.
While there's no reason to believe Temujin was directly aware of these efforts, the parallels are striking.

To become the undisputed ruler of the Mongolian people, Temujin still had two final trials.
He would have to defeat the tribe of Ong Khan, his mentor, guardian, and friend of his fathers, who would 
try to poison him, forcing him to flee precariously into the mountains, marking the low point of his 
military career. He would miraculously survive, find new, empire defining strength, and return in a successful
surprise attack on the Ong Khan. He would also have to defeat the tribe of his oldest friend, Jamuka, 
with whom he had sworn a blood oath many years prior, but whom had since become an arch enemy. Jamuka would eventually surrender
and ask to be killed to serve the khan better as a spirit in death. 

At this point, Temujin was elevated to the status of Great Ruler of the newly formed Great Mongol Nation
of over a million people and around 15-20 million animals distributed across the Mongolian steppe.
His Mongolian title was Chinggis Khan, Khan of the people of the strong, fearless, wolf. In Persian,
it was Genghis Khan.
