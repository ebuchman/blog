This post is part of a series on the Properties of Money. See the
[introduction][intro] 

In the [last post][origin]
we explored the Unit of Account, its origin, and its function in denominating debt.
We saw how the Unit of Account manifests in anthropological and political forms,
in outside and inside monies. Here we explore the tension between the Unit of
Account and Medium of Exchange, between elasticity and discipline: the elasticity of denominating debt,
and the discipline of discharging it here and now. We call this tension
*liquidity*.

## Hierarchy of Money

The distinction between inside and outside money opens up a kind of hierarchy,
rooted in outside money, and branching into increasingly contained insides.
We call this the Hierarchy of Money. The hierarchy is old, as old as the origin
of political money itself (~5000 years ago). But it starts to become
increasingly more visible and widespread with the emergence of bookeeping in Italy, 
and accelerates with the adoption of bank deposits as means of exchange. 
Bank deposits are the most common example of the emergence of
a widely successful inside money.

More generally, we can think of inside and outside money as relative terms,
relative to a particular community. Money created on the balance sheets of the community's members is
inside money, and money created outside the community is outside money. That is,
the creation of inside money requires a kind of trust in a community, a capacity to extend
credit (to believe promises). The use of outside money indicates the need to transact with someone outside the community,
or else to a kind of limit on the ability to generate sufficient trust within the community. In either case, it is a need to turn to a
"higher" source of trust - a more reliable issuer of promises. 

For most of us, our primary outside money is our bank deposits - the liabilities
of commercial banks. But to commercial banks, their respective liabilities are a
kind of inside money. This is often true, that one community's outside money is
another's inside money. The banks, for instance have their own outside money - 
the bank reserves on the balance sheet of their central bank, which are in turn
an inside money for the community of central banks. The outside money of the
central banks is the US dollar. And while the US Fed once also had an outside
money in the form of gold, it now doesn't seem to be grounded by any kind of
an outside money at all. Which is an interesting kind of a problem.

<!-- Consider each bank as its own little community, consisting of the bank and its
depositors, generating its own inside money on the balance sheet of the bank.
Then there is the community of banks themselves, along with their central
banks, that take great pains to make these different inside monies appear
fully fungible and interchangable with eachother - to ensure a deposit with one
bank can be easily transformed into a deposit with another one. 
This is in some
sense the whole point of a banking system, a system that appears to be failing
before our eyes as we witness some of the largest bank failures in history
cascade through 2023 - seeing clearly the difference between one bank's
liabilities and another.
--> 

Communities are thus organized into a hierarchy according to the relation
between their inside and outside monies. At the very top of the hierarchy 
is the US central bank, followed by the other central banks, which manage the
high powered money of their nations. Next are the commercial banks, 
who are granted license by their governments to create an inside money
that is deemed valid outside money for *everyone else*. 
And then there is everyone else, who are hardly trusted to generate their
own inside monies at all, except in limited cases, or in the basic case of IOUs
between groups of friends.

## Balancing the Books

What's notable about inside money - 
about accounting solely on the balance sheets of a community - 
is the possibility it opens for *clearing*, which could be defined as a kind of
settlement that does not require the transfer of an outside money.
Bookeeping and banking enabled clearing activities to flourish. Today, apps like Splitwise let groups of friends clear
their own inside money. In contrast to *settlement* without clearing, which requires
outside money be transferred to discharge a debt, clearing allows 
debts to be discharged by balancing transactions within and across balance sheets,
without resorting to a medium "higher" in the hierarchy. 

Consider a simple example. Leaving out other complexities of the payments
system, suppose I can pay you in gold, in bank deposits, or in bilateral IOUs.
Gold is the highest level in the hierarchy, a universal outside money, and I
can pay you in gold by physically transfering it to you. But if we
both have an account at the same bank, I can pay you by having the bank simply 
update its balance sheet to owe me less and you more - so we can clear debts at a 
lower level in the hierarchy, without resorting to gold, directly on the bank's balance sheet. 
For me, this is still settlement, because bank deposits are outside money for
me. But for the bank, it's *clearing*, since it can effect the transfer directly
on its balance sheet - an inside money - without resorting to a higher layer. 

But if you and I have continuous bilateral obligations, where I owe you and
later you owe me, we could continuously renew and redeem monetary debts to
one another without ever having to transfer any kind of money at all, just by keeping bilateral accounts
between ourselves - the lowest level in a hierarchy of money, our
own IOUs. In this case, we're issuing our own inside money, and so we can
benefit from clearing.

This hierarchy is a hierarchy of computational spaces, where each space
constitutes its own medium for the denomination and discharge of debts. The line begins to blur
between the Unit of Account and Medium of Exchange, as the balance sheets on
which we account become media themselves for discharging debts. 
Both inside and outside moneys can function as media of exchange. 
But while inside money emerges from the elastic capacity of the Unit of Account
to denominate debt, outside money manifests in the discipline imposed by the Medium
of Exchange to discharge debt here and now. 

Hence, media of exchange are most commonly
thought of as outside money. For most people, this is their commercial bank
deposits. For the banks, its the central bank reserves. However, 
the banks also have tremendous networks of inside money, which form a very real
medium of exchange for them, and serve as the substrate of the eurodollar
system. These inside monies are built out of the trust generated within the
banking community in its own network of debt denomination. To the extent that
trust falters, the entire global financial system seems to face crisis. But what would it look
like to build this kind of trust in other communities? Perhaps we could build a
more robust and sustainable finance?

We could thus say that the medium we use depends on where we can source both
transactions and trust. If we can source enough trust and enough of our transactions
from our collective capacity to denominate debts,
we can generate inside money as a means of exchange. But if we cannot generate
enough trust within our community, or if we need to transact outside of it, we
require a higher source of trust, from an outside value store - an outside money.

We could also say that inside money appears as a medium of exchange based in the Unit of Account function,
while outside money appears as a medium of exchange based in the Store of Value
function. Of course we'll have to come back to value storage, which is
what secures our ability to discharge debt *elsewhere or later*, but for now we are concerned with the Medium of Exchange
and the need to discharge debt *here and now*.

To summarize. You and I can keep track of what we owe eachother, and maybe do some clearing, 
but our real Medium of Exchange is our bank deposits, which we'll use to settle
our debts if an imbalance between us persists too long. But if we bank at
different banks, those banks will have debts to one another, which they might be
able to clear bilateraly, but if imbalances persist too long, they will also
have to rise to a higher level in the hierarchy to settle, for instance with the
Medium of Exchange of bank reserves on the balance sheet of the central bank. 

The point of all this is to demonstrate that access to a higher level of the hierarchy - 
access to outside money or the medium of exchange -
is only necessary in so far as there are *imbalances* in 
the payments graph being cleared in the lower level, and/or insufficient trust to
roll over the imabalance into the future.
We find here the deep tension between the Unit of Account and the Medium of
Exchange - between the elasticity permitted by the Unit of Account to denominate debt,
and the discipline asserted by the Medium of Exchange to discharge that debt
here and now. 

The Unit of Account permits us to create computational spaces - our network of balance sheets - where 
we can account for debts and clear them against eachother.
But to the extent there is insufficient bandwidth or capacity in that space,
insufficient balance across our sheets, computation must spill out into a medium higher in the hierarchy, 
in order for debts to settle. This is the process at the heart of the financial
system: settlement. The Unit of Account lets us denominate and clear debts against eachother,
but, in general, it takes a Medium of Exchange to settle them.

## Settling Up

The Unit of Account allows debts to be denominated, but it does not in itself prescribe
how they should be settled. Many governments will endow a particular medium of exchange
with legal tender status (eg. bank notes), 
while other media of exchange continue to be used alongside them (eg. fintech).
Debts can also be settled in-kind, which is to say by something else valued in the Unit of Account
equivalently to the original debt - could be some labour time, a flock of chickens, a gold bracelet, and so on. 
This implies storing value somewhere else besides the medium of exchange, and using it to settle debt when necessary, if
possible. But arguably, the ideal way to settle is not to settle with outside money but to clear - 
to bypass the transfer of any medium of exchange altogether, and instead maintain 
a pattern of reciprocal obligations that can be netted. I owe you,
and later, you will owe me, and so on. Monetary transactions without the use of
any money.

This isn't barter, since it's not synchronous. 
Credits (e.g. invoices) are being issued and cleared in a Unit of Account. 
These are deferred payments. But to the extent opposing
payments can be simply set-off against eachother, 
no generally accepted medium of exchange need come into existence at all - 
value is instead stored in the real world, 
in the continuous productive capacities of the
reciprocal agents. This is what allows us to do clearing, to perform monetary
computation without resorting to the liquidity of a medium of exchange.

Of course, most agents don't have fully reciprocal relations like this, allowing them
to avoid payment in the Medium of Exchange by just clearing in the Unit of Account. I pay my accountant for their services, 
but they don't pay me for anything (at least not
yet!), so I can't do any clearing with them - I have to pay them cash. 
Again, the Medium of Exchange is only needed in so far as there
are imbalances in the payments graph. But every firm has many customers and many vendors, 
and collectively they continuously create and renew a vast network of payment obligations (the "trade
credit" network), which is at the core of the real economy.

Within this network, we can ask about the patterns of flow, and in particular whether there
are closed loops ("cycles") that can be cleared without the need for
balances in a medium of exchange to materialize or flow. 
If I owe Abed $10 and Abed owes Troy $7 and Troy
owes me $4, we can clear what's common ($4) from all of them, leaving everyone
only owing the difference ($6 for me and $3 for Abed). 
The Medium of Exchange is needed only in so far as there are imbalances in the payment graph.

![Set-off Cycle][img-cycle]
*Clearing a balanced flow of debt. What remains is the imbalance.*


By mapping the obligation graph and identifying cycles, we can *save* liquidity.
We need less money for the same volume of transactions, just by taking advantage
of existing structure in the graph. All forms of clearing can be considered
effectively as increasing the [velocity of money](/posts/velocity). 
But the presence of these cycles, and the opportunity to clear them, presents 
as a higher order phenomenon that requires and supports a greater degree of
collaboration. It suggests a way for us to
quantify the quality of our money: quality money flows in
cycles.[^energy-cycles]

## Wherefore Art Thou Liquiity?

But not all money flows in cycles, at least not on a short time horizon, which
means even if we clear all the debt that exists in cycles, there are debts left over -
imbalances in the payments graph.
More anxiously, then, we might ask how these imbalances, built up in the networks of trade and finance,
might relate to the general availability of the Medium of Exchange required to settle them.
Say, to the extent that obligations are not part of closed loops that can be
netted out, where and how are we to get the media to settle them all? And why should there be enough of it? 
Wherefore art thou liquidity?

This tension, between the elasticity of the Unit of Account and the discipline of the Medium of Exchange,
is what the entire edifice of banking and central banking has
historically been charged with navigating - to enable payments to continue flowing, to
keep things *liquid*. Notably, at the trade fairs of the 16th century and earlier, 
before the rise of central banks, 
a huge volume of European credit was settled by netting out obligation cycles and
collapsing chains of obligations in a decentralized clearing process called
the *rescontre*.[^rescontre] The process was so efficient, the merchant-bankers hardly needed
to use any money at all, and generally only brought enough with them for their personal
expenses. These fairs were phenomenal in their pursuit of balancing the payments
graph.[^boyer]

But this balancing act would soon give way to a new institutional form.
By the end of the 16th century, the institutions of money found themselves on the precipice of 
a transformation from engine of trade to engine of war finance. Not that money
hadn't for millenia been intimitately tied up in war. But a monetary and
financial revolution was looming that would institutionalize a new kind of imbalance: 
the permanent debts of the state. Responsibility for monetizing these debts
would be distributed across a new kind of banking system taking hold of Europe, anchored
by Central Banks.

States had always borrowed, for all we know as far back as they existed. But
they borrowed primarily in times of emergency, to fight war, and otherwise
strove to repay their debts, and to run surplusses in peace time. In other
words, they did not run permanent deficits. Occasionally, they would default and cause crisis.
It wasn't until the 16th century alliance between the Spanish crown and
the Genoese bankers, fuelled by a new source of silver in the Americas, that the
political and financial machinery was worked out to create permanent deficit
financing for states. In the case of the Spanish, it was to finance an 80 years
war against the Dutch. But not long after, in the early 17th c, the permanent
deficit became a phenomenon of peace time in the hands of the British state
under the Stuarts. And the crisis wrought by the Spanish-Genoese alliance on the
older international trade fairs in the late 16th century led to the rise of new clearing infrastructure
in the form of central banks, beginning especially with the Bank of Amsterdam at
the start of the 17th century, and culminating in the bank of England at the end.

As central banks and centralized clearing unions came to take over from the 
decentralized clearing fairs, they would introduce a new kind of money, the bank "reserves",
that could function as a Medium of Exchange within the clearing union. 
Global payments and finance moved from a system based on clearing via an international unit of account (the
*ecu de marc* of the exchange bankers), used
primarily to *save* liquidity, to one based on settlement via an international medium of
exchange (the new gold reserve currencies), used to *provide* liquidity. 
Attention turned from balancing the payments graph (saving liquidity) to issuing enough
reserves (providing it). We transitioned from a quality theory of money (money flowing in cycles) 
to a quantity theory (money accumulating in volume).

Concerns continue to abound as to the problem of responsibly issuing reserves,
most commonly today in the context of an explosion of reserves on the balance sheets
of the world's central banks since 2008. The debate rages over what these reserves are and what they
matter for. Are they even money? If so, they're only money for banks, and most 
interbank transactions don't use them anyways. The problem of liquidity is
buried in the shadows of the network of bank balance sheets and the credits they create with
one another. But inconcistencies and imbalances in these networks periodicially spill over
into the visible realm of bank reserves in the great liquidity crises of banking history. 
And such crises are becoming increasingly common.

## Booking the Balance

Historically, economic thought had largely failed to theorize
correctly about this tension in the structure of the payments graph - about the
problem of liquidity - despite a complex and sophisticated payments system
developing before and alongside it in the form of Europe's great banking networks. 
Of course the bankers themselves weren't particularly keen to write treatises
divulging the secrets of their business, and often operated with more than a
flair of secrecy. Thus the discovery of economics in the academy found itself 
largely bound up in theorizing about mutual gains to trade, where trade was
conceived in the form of barter, and the temporal structure of the trade
credit and payments system that served as the actual engine of trade was practically ignored.
Instead, the cheap or practically free availability of liquidity provided by
dealers was taken for granted almost as a form of mysticism, 
until it would seize up in the recurrent
liquidity crises of the last few centuries, only to be remythologized by the
action of great priests employed by the world's central banks. 

Ability to theorize about these problems wasn't wholly absent, however.
In the 19th century, Marx identified a tendency towards liquidity crisis in
capitalism, though his analysis remained more theoretical than institutional.
Walter Bagehot, on the other hand, investigated the institutional structure of
liquidity and conjured the famous Bagehot rule hailed as the foundation of
modern central banking practice. But neither seemed to focus in on the core
network structure, on the need to balance the payments graph. Marx infamously
advocated for political revolution, while Bagehot advocated for a more
responsible management of reserves.[^bagehot-freebanking]

The 20th century, in Europe, especially, saw growing recognition of the
importance of this problem, of balancing the payments graph via clearing rather
than perennially issuing reserves to support settlement.
Keynes' *bancor* proposal at Bretton Woods, 
which was based on E.F. Schumachers work on multi-lateral
clearing,[^schumacher] was a recognition of the need to balance the 
global payments graph between countries by using a global Unit of Account - the bancor.
Of course Keynes' plan failed in favour of an American gold-exchange standard
and American management of the issuance of global monetary reserves - the USD. 
But USD liquidity wasn't sufficient to reboot European economies amidst the tangled
web of bilateral trade relations that emerged after the war. It took the
European Payments Union to do that, an institution designed to balance the
payments graph amongst its members by transferring those bilateral relations to
multilateral ones that could be cleared.[^end-of-finance-epu]
The EPU was deemed such a success they thought they no longer
needed it, and tragically shut it down after less than 10 years. It would almost
immediately be replaced by the nascent eurodollar system.
Later on in the 60s, when the US had become the world's largest debtor,
and was pushing for the creation of new reserve assets at the IMF (the
SDRs), the European representatives insisted that there was no need for more
reserve assets, but rather a need to balance the payments
graph.[^superimperialism]

These calls to balance the payments graph harken back to the trade fairs,
which were able to clear huge volumes of trade without the need for almost any
liquidity - the graph was balanced. How it came to be
unbalanced, and how the financial system transitioned from a principle of
clearing (that is, liquidity saving) to one of liquidity (that is, liquidity
provisioning), is a deep historical question that may lie at the heart of the
large-scale destructive effects of capitalism on the world.

## Respect the Graph

Money, its instabilities, and the anxieties it produces, are ancient phenomena.
As a technology of debt denomination and discharge, money posits a discipline of predicting
the future, predicting the ability for people to pay back debts. 
But these predictions regularly fail as imbalances build up in the obligation graph from a multitude
of sources, including natural shocks, internal mismanagement, and the institutional
power structure itself. It is the prerogative of Sovereignty to address
this problem, to define the means to relieve overbearing debts. 

Before coinage, states relieved debt through jubilee, where the ruler
periodically declared the relief of non-commercial obligations. With coinage, 
a new sovereign power to manage debt emerged in the spread between the
nominal and intrinsic value of the coin - the sovereign could enforce, at least
locally, and within some constraints, that the coin was worth more than the metal inside it.
Reducing the amount of metal in the coinage thus became a means of effecting debt
relief. Of course this capacity could also be greatly abused by the sovereign
itself, to relieve its own debts.[^debasement]

Modern Capitalism is marked by a new kind of debt relief, an
institutionaliation of the debts of the sovereign in a manner
in which they are never really expected to be paid back - they are perenially
deferred by becoming money. This perennial rolling over of debt gives cover to a
new scale of accumulation and growth, the results of which are apparent all
around us. 

The liquidity risk that defines the banking system has been the major focus
of central banks in the 20th century, though they have largely failed to properly
understand its nature and how to address it. Instead, they have become captured
by a paradigm of systemic risk,[^captured-risk] and find themselves compounding
moral hazard at the heart of the financial system by providing debt relief on an
adhoc basis to reckless financial institutions and other large firms. 
Their interventions are clumsy, at best symptomatic treatments, 
at worst accelerating inequality and sabotaging the real economy.

While central banks think they are creating oceans of liquitity to drench the world in, 
the bank reserves they create have so little to do with the process of real
world production and trade that the small and medium sized enterprises at the heart of the economy 
have been virtually cut off from credit. Since the collapse of the eurodollar engine in 2008, and exacerbated by 
the Basel regulations, liquidity has all but vanished.

Fortunately, there is hope, and it does not depend on the coordinated action of
large players. Rather, modern technology allows us to revisit the 
mechanisms of the trade fairs to enable clearing across large numbers of firms
without any liquidity at all, or in ways that reduce the amount of liquidity
required. Networks of trade can fight back against the
entrenched powers and their hoarding of liquidity through explicit
collaboration, restoring the medium of exchange as a vehicle for clearing debts,
rather than for accumulating value.

This is the approach behind [Cycles][cycles], an open clearing protocol, designed to clear
the most debt for the most people with the least money.
Cycles is based on understanding the payments graph itself -
mapping it, finding cycles, clearing them, and encouraging their sustainable growth.
But it also gives us new insights into the optimal injection of liquidity into
the graph - namely, liquidity can be injected in ways that optimize for network
level properties, rather than being injected on an ad-hoc and discretionary
basis to individual nodes by banks. This has the potential to transform the
realm of commnunity financing and banking, not to mention how we measure
sustainable economic growth itself.

At the heart of this thinking is the problem of imbalances in the payment graph - 
what can't be accounted for and thus cleared in the UoA alone,
and how they must "spill out" into the domain of the Medium of Exchange. 
We will turn to the Medium of Exchange, next.

[^energy-cycles]: Sustainable systems are those that are able to continuously
    cycle energy. This is the intuition behind "circular economics." But it can
    be nurtured by design of the monetary system to focus on the flows and the cyclic
    structure of the network ("quality theory of money") rather than the
    stocks and the aggregate structure ("quantity theory"). See my post on
    [the velocity of money][velocity] and my talk on 
    [Stakeholders and Statemachines][stakeholders-and-statemachines] for more.
[^rescontre]: See Borner & Hatfield (2017) for a historical overview as well as economic analysis of the Pareto 
efficiency of these mechanisms. Merchant bankers met quarterly at the fairs with
their books of bills of exchange and spent a few days finding chains and loops of bills
with others at the fair that could be cleared. This decentalized clearing
was ultimately replaced by central banks and clearing houses which,
though technically less Pareto efficient, were able to incentivize use through
other means. 
[^boyer]: See Boyer-Xambeu et al (1994) for a detailed exposé of how 
    the payments graph was balanced, and the incentivizes for balancing it. They argue that
    merchant bankers organized a hierarchical system of exchange rates anchored
    in the fairs of a central city, and that by balancing the graph of payments,
    they were able to systematically harvest as profit the seinorage charged by princes.
    In other words, balancing the payments graph allowed them to systematically profit by 
    exploiting the spread created by seignorage on coins. This system was
    originally anchored by the Florentine bankers in the fairs of Lyons under alliance with
    the French crown, an arrangement that was ultimately disrupted by the Genoese
    bankers and their alliance with the Spain crown. The Genoese-Spanish
    alliance introduced a structural imbalance based around financing the
    Spanish military effort, and ushered in what Arrighi (1994) calls the first
    "systemic cycle of accumulation."
[^bagehot-freebanking]: Bagehot is famous for his advice to central banks,
    that in times of crisis they should "lend freely, at high interest, on good
    collateral, to solvent firms". This is the "Bagehot rule".
    While lip service continues to be paid to Bagehot and his rule, and
    especially to "lend freely", too often it is done at low interest, on junk
    collateral, to insolvent firms. Notably, and less well known, Bagehot was
    actually against the system of central banking, and preferred a system of
    competitive note issue between private banks, where each bank held and
    managed its own gold reserves, rather than pooling them all with the Bank of
    England. See, for instance, the openning to the concluding chapter in Bagehot (1873).
    This is known as "free banking," and is not to be confused with the much
    less responsible "wildcat banking" that emerged in 19th century USA. Sound
    free banking systems thrived during the 19th century in Scotland and Canada.

  was the basis for Keynes' bancor proposal at Bretton Woods, though somewhat
  controversially, and perhaps due to the politics of the situation, Keynes never gave him credit for it.
