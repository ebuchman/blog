- alleges we haven't contributed anything meaningful to the debate over shadow banking or financial stability, to theories of liquidity, to any historical debates, etc etc.  
- this is kinda true, but there's lots of potential here, seemingly especially

        - prop to size of trade, inverse to size of balance sheet
    - dealers quote larger trades based on end prices - worse for traders
    - lack of competition means error in outside spreads dont pass through

- AMM 
    - transparent pool of liquidity
    - fixed inside spread
