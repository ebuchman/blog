The great tragedy of mainstream, neoclassical economics is that, 
in trying to transform the Classical political-economy of the 19th century 
into a more mathematical science of economics, it butchered its political and moral foundation. 

It all started with a good idea - from Menger, Jevons, and Walras - 
of the subjective nature of value and the marginal utility of goods.
The "marginal revolution", as we know it today, enabled supply and demand to be
treated analytically with the tools of calculus, and for equations to be solved
that maximize utility and minimize costs. This seemed to work well in 
isolated, simple circumstances, say the market for a particular commodity.
But the techniques were rapidly applied to model more complex chains of
production, and even entire economies. In doing so, the field got carried away in 
grossly insufficient, if not negligent, mathematical representations of the
structures of production, and of the human and natural worlds that support them.

The insufficiency, and moral dereliction, of modern neoclassical economics is
widely known and understood. Hence the growing prominence of so-called
heterodox schools: Austrian, Ecological, Feminist, Georgist, Institutional,
Post-Keynesian, etc. There are certainly truths in each of these. Perhaps we
should be seeking a kind of heterodox synthesis.

Consider that the trouble with economics perhaps lies in our conception of the
factors of production themselves (land, labour, capital, etc.) -
that we are suffering from an incomplete social theory of these factors
and their relationships to each other.
Neoclassical economics has dramatically, if not immorally, oversimplified 
in its treatment of the factors.

Each heterodox school is in some sense associated with a critique of one or another factor:
the Georgists with Land, the Feminists and Institutionalists with Labour,
the Austrians and Post-Keynesians with Capital (and also with Money)
and the Ecological economists with Energy.
Even the central bankers are calling bullshit on the neoclassical 
descriptions of money!

The factors of Land and Labour, the very substance of natural and
human life, have been reduced to mere commodity - 
*fictitious commodities*, as Polanyi so aptly calls them.
The factor of Capital has been woefully misunderstood
and its theory stunted, at least since the Cambridge Capital Controversy died in
the 1960s, if not since Hayek stopped working on it in 1940. The factor of
Energy is largely excluded all together, or else included without any regard for the
laws of thermodynamics. And the factor of Money, if it is not confused up with
that of Capital, is hardly even considered a factor at all.

Of course, the factors of production are themselves an abstraction, invented in
the course of that throbbing historical revolution which wrestled
markets out of their underlying social fabric and subjugated society to economy, 
giving birth to Capitalisms proper and the market society. But are we forever
doomed to the lifeless treatment of these factors, which we have inherited over
the decades and centuries? I surely hope not.

It is high time for a reconsideration of the factors of production
as a basis for a more sound political-economy.
In such a reconsideration, we ought to be truer to the character of each factor, 
and to the relationships between them. No longer may the factors be taken to be mere commodities,
simple inputs to a production function. Each factor is deserving of its own
dedicated social theory. And surely, we cannot possibly hope to capture the
complexities and impacts of our socioeconomies without including Energy and Money
among the critical primary factors. 

Consider that the factors emerge phylogenetically out of each other, in order,
beginning with Land, and proceeding with Labour, Capital, Energy, and Money. 
Higher order factors, in turn, feedback on lower-order ones, thereby
transforming them. Each factor might be said to expand the scope of activity possible on Land in
a new dimension by augmenting the prior factors. Labour enables precision and mobility in *space*. Capital 
enables Labour to make trade-offs in *time*. Energy enables Capital to increase
the scale of *energy* utilized. And Money, as we conceive it here, enables *maturity transformation*, 
which facilitates the development of high energy capital. It is questionable
whether it would even be possible to finance our high energy industry on savings
alone were it not for maturity transformation. In this sense, we might consider
Money to be the shadow cast by Capital under the light of Energy. We might
similarly consider that Money has a similar relationship to Energy as Capital
does to Labour - a kind of augmentation in *time*.

We are accustomed to understanding that the share of income is distributed
across the factors, with rent to Land, wages to Labour, and interest to Capital.
If we are to include Energy and Money, then, what is to be their share? 
First, in the tradition of Wicksell (on whose work both the Austrians and
Keynesians have drawn heavily), we distinguish between a capital-rate of
interest (what Wicksell called the "natural" rate), and the money-rate of interest. 
The former being the rate of interest paid on capital lent in kind, the latter being the money interest we
are used to. In practice, of course, it is money that is lent, and not capital,
but the distinction will likely be paramount to a proper understanding, lest we
lose sight of the meaning of interest itself. The money-rate of interest may
indeed be a simple policy variable (as the MMT crowd claims), but the 
capital-rate of interest is most certainly not.

And what about Energy? It is difficult to see a distinct share of income due to
Energy in the manner of rent, wages, and interest.
But what if instead of thinking of these as shares of income, we
consider them as *costs*? Rent as the cost of employing Land, wages the cost of Labour, etc. 
The use of Energy surely has a cost - we may call it *entropy*. 
It is borne by all, earned by none. Ignorance of this cost lies at the heart of
much of the worlds unsustainable practices.

We summarize this conception in the table below:

| Factor    |   Dimension               |   Cost    |   Heterodox School |
|-----------|---------------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| Land      |   Matter                  | Rent             | Georgist
| Labour    |   Space                   | Wages            | Feminist, Institutionalist
| Capital   |   Time                    | Capital-interest | Austrian, Post-Keynesian
| Energy    |   Energy                  | Entropy          | Ecological
| Money     |   Maturity Transformation | Money-interest   | Austrian, Post-Keynesian

There is much more to be said about all of this - about the social theories
proffered by each school, about the ways in which the factors transform
each other (for instance, the way in which high Energy Capital interferes with
the ability of Labour to provide for itself, a misery that plays out in the
medium of Money), about the implications for a more grounded form of market
society (for instance, perhaps we should be using a variety of Moneys, each
tuned to the scale of Energy being employed), etc. But we will leave all that to future writings.
