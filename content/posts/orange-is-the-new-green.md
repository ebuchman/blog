## Introduction

Earlier this year, Tesla purchased $1.5B worth of BTC to hold on its balance
sheet. This seems to have made a lot of people angry, or at least
confused, including Elon Musk himself.
Tesla, a bastion of our clean energy future, is helping us transition
from fossil fuels to electricity.
Bitcoin, a speculative digital asset, is using more energy 
than Switzerland and is (or at least was!) largely powered by dirty coal mined in China. 
What gives?

At the time, [I suggested][tweet-bitcoin-tesla] that Bitcoin might actually be better for the
environment than Tesla. On the surface, this seems absurd. 
But our world and socioeconomy is a complex and
dynamic place. Our environmental impact cannot be denominated purely in carbon
emissions. Yes, we need cleaner sources of energy. Obviously. But we've also
grounded our economics in obscene assumptions about indefinite exponential growth on a
finite planet. Simply adopting a cleaner source of energy doesn't actually
help us there. We still consume and dispose of all kinds of materials at unsustainable levels,
and we prioritize abstract "economic growth" over biodiversity and human well
being. We're going to need 
[deeper structural changes to our economic system][reconsidering]
if we actually want to get serious about sustainability. Tesla is not
helping bring about those changes. Bitcoin might be.

## Green Tech

Tesla helps entrench and exacerbate a number of existing problems in the world.

One is American capitalism itself. There are obviously good ideas at the heart
of American capitalism, about entrepreneurship, competition, and the power of mutually
beneficial exchange to drive progress. But the modern incarnation of military-industrial,
monopolistic, American consumerism is not particularly nurturing for a sustainable future. 
Tesla is perhaps American capitalism's best foot forward.

Another is the supply chain of modern technology.
The mining industry, for metals like Lithium, Coltan, and more,
is [riddled with environmental and human rights abuses][supply-chain].
These are not so much measured in carbon emissions (though there are plenty)
as in pollution and destruction of natural habitats and social relationships.
And a car battery requires many orders of magnitude more Lithium than your Macbook. 
Clean energy has a very dirty supply chain, and little incentive to improve it.

A third is cars themselves. The complete centrality of cars in the
organization of urban life is one of the great tragedies
of our time. Sustainability is intimately bound up with how we organize ourselves
on the surface of the planet. Cars, electric or otherwise, are not
particularly conducive to the more human-scale and bio-diverse patterns that are 
critical to sustainability. To the extent that we have cars, they should probably be electric. 
But more than anything, we need less cars. Denmark has the right idea. As does
anyone who's ever gotten a street closed to cars, for any duration. Respect.

Now I'm not trying to dis Tesla, per sse. 
Tesla is the beacon of a research and development process that is itself critical to
sustainability. And if we want to make progress in batteries, which we should, cars are a great
vehicle to ground that R&D. But the fundamental problems we're facing today don't seem so much technical as they
do political-economic. More R&D in capitalist companies with dirty supply chains
feeding conspicuous consumerism can only help so much.

## Orange Money

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a different kind of a thing altogether.
Yes, Bitcoin is being exploited by American capitalism. Yes, Bitcoin mining
hardware inherits the same dirty tech supply chain. And Yes, Bitcoin uses an
extreme amount of energy. But as far as agents of structural institutional
change at the global level for a more sustainable civilization go? Bitcoin might 
be the best thing we've ever seen.

That's a pretty bold statement. And I don't expect to fully convince you here. 
I merely intend to suggest that it's worth thinking about. Bitcoin is
taking its seat at the table of international monetary institutions.
Its market capitalization today (~$900B), is larger than *every one* of the major American
banks and payments companies. It's also larger than most of the world's national
currencies, and almost as much as silver. Bitcoin is even set to become legal tender in El Salvador next month, 
and is under consideration for legal tender status in a number of other South American countries.

But Bitcoin isn't a precious metal. And it's not something produced by a company, nor a government, 
nor really any distinctly identifiable organization.
Bitcoin is a collective. An open-source, verifiable, transparent, decentralized, 
collective hosting a store of value and a medium of exchange for all to use on
equal terms without discrimination. Isn't that the kind of stuff that sustainable human institutions
are made of?

As a collective, Bitcoin shares more of its
character with religion than with enterprise, more with performance art than
with industrial production. This is true of all money: 
it is the materialized mythology of a society's roots and values, its fruits and
dreams. It is a means to bind society in a coordinated web of promises and their redemption.
And Bitcoin is [good art][epsilon-theory-bitcoin].
The dollar, which has since been captured, corrupted, and calcified, was perhaps once
good art too.

Some believe that Bitcoin's philosophy stems from a kind of 
[far-right market fundamentalism][politics-of-bitcoin]. And surely there is some truth to that.
But Bitcoin emerged in response to the reckless behaviour and moral hazard 
in the banking system that precipitated the Global Financial Crisis, which put many
millions of people around the globe out of work, evaporated their life savings,
and paid out massive bonuses to the architects of the collapse. 
Bitcoin draws its life force as much from a more left-wing tradition of open-source collectivism 
and Institutional economics as it does from say the Austrian or Chicago schools. 
Bitcoin is as much Elinor Ostrom as it is Friedrich Hayek.
That is to say, [Bitcoin is for Progressives][bitcoin-progressives].

## The Root of All Evil

Like any monetary institution, Bitcoin is designed to nurture a kind of *trust*
among the members of the society it serves. But it does so in a very different way from the
monetary institutions of the nation states. Many of the problems we face today, of inequality and sustainability, 
can be traced back to the institutions of money. 
Not that these issues are caused by our monetary institutions per se, but that they
are greatly amplified by them. How is money created? Who is it distributed to? What is it distributed
for? 

Modern institutions of money have become enormously extractive and rent-seeking. 
They have brought about a tectonic decoupling between financial activity
and the real socioeconomic activity of the human and natural world. 
Modern finance is notorious for its inherent instability and fragility,
for fuelling unsustainable speculative fires, for exacerbating income inequality,
for failing to adequately support essential labour and services in its value system.
The monetary institutions of the nation states are intimately bound up in the mayhem 
wrought by the global financial system - they have thus dramatically betrayed the trust of the societies they serve.

At least some of this appears due to a collapse in the literal values of money as a
representative media. Unmoored from any real world process, 
modern money multiplies monstrously under the machinations of central bankers.
Its creation and distribution ceases to represent any meaningful or socially
valuable information in the real world. As a device for transmitting value
judgements, it thus becomes increasingly faulty. Modern Monetary
Theorists will have you believe that they can rejuvenate the values of money by moving the printing press from the central bank to congress - 
but [I have my reservations](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/mmt/).
Insofar as [sustainable systems are those with sound representations of their environment within their own structure](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/2019-01-20-economic-organisms/),
our modern monetary systems are inherently unsustainable.

So what are we to do about this rampant inequality, about global
unsustainability? We tried to Occupy Wall Street.
We try to organize strikes, and to boycott corporations.
We try to elect better politicians.
We try to make individual life style changes, to bank at credit unions, to stop
buying from Amazon, to [invest in local community bonds instead of the stock
market][social-investing]. But the problem of collective action remains. In a
utopian dream, we'd all wake up one day and cease our destructive ways. But in
practice, what can we do? How can we create real space for change? 
How can we create something new, a protest that cannot be shut down,
an institution that enables coordination at global scale for a better political-economy? 
This is where new forms of money might have a real role to play.
Monetary institutions are a gateway, a point of leverage, into the larger political-economic
problems we face.

Bitcoin is the first, and so far most credible, attempt to challenge the current
paradigm, to meaningfully innovate internationally in the basic values of money.
Yes, it manifests largely as a speculative asset right now. 
But Bitcoin provides a new source of *trust* for international monetary institutions
that is grounded, as we'll see, in verifiable physical reality, in the thermodynamics of computation.
While not perfect by any means (nothing is!), Bitcoin anchors a new generation
of monetary institutions in one of the most fundamental physical processes underlying our civilization.

And Bitcoin is starting to find success as a fledgling monetary institution.
This is not to say that it will or must necessarily become money for the whole world. But it is
beginning to fulfill some meaningful functions of money in certain growing
contexts - it's being increasingly used to pay salaries, to make international payments and remittances, and 
as a highly liquid (though volatile) reserve asset on corporate balance sheets.
It's also finding increasing utility among the people of countries with unstable currencies and authoritarian governments.

<!-- The latter seems to really undercut the reality. The vast majority of bitcoin use has been for this speculative, finance, no? -->
Of course it's also being used increasingly in ransomware payments and as fodder
for speculative finance. In ransomware, it tragically illuminates the pervasive insecurity 
and fragility of the systems underlying our critical infrastructure. In finance, it fuels the same kind
of [leveraged and nebulous behaviour][tether] as the rest of the [shadow banking] system.
Perhaps the greatest risk to Bitcoin is that it is [swallowed up by Wall
St][epsilon-theory-bitcoin].

Surely, Bitcoin is not alone the solution to the world's monetary problems. 
It may be necessary, but it's certainly not sufficient.
Bitcoin proves the potential of money whose issuance and distribution is based on 
socially valuable activity, as determined by the network participants themselves. In the
case of Bitcoin, that activity is the energy intensive Proof-of-Work mining. But Bitcoin
is just the first stage in a journey towards increasingly representative monetary
systems that sustainably [bridge the gap from local self-sufficiency to global
luxuries and back][tweet-crypto-thesis]. 


## In Proof we Trust

Bitcoin are created and issued to those who provably contribute to
the security of the Bitcoin network via Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining.
Proof-of-Work entails a specific kind of cryptographic computation resembling
a numerical puzzle that is difficult to solve but easy to verify. If
computing power were evenly distributed throughout humanity (which of course
it's not), Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work mining would be a sort of Universal Basic Job, 
providing income to anyone who ran a Bitcoin miner.
The energy used would be stable and proportional to human population. 

Of course in the real world, Bitcoin mining is a highly specialized economic
game played out in transistor sizes and electricity sources. 
Smaller, faster chips; cheaper, denser energy. The distribution of mining power is nowhere near uniform.
Nevertheless, Proof-of-Work appears to be the best known manner to solve the
problem of [Sybil Attacks](sybil-attack) in open, permissionless, global systems. This makes it the best known
mechanism to "fairly" distribute coins in a monetary system without strong identity.

For years now, the Bitcoin mining network has been the world's largest supercomputer,
more powerful than all the other supercomputers combined, though it is computing only a single rather simple
function with seemingly little practical value. 
So what do we even get for all this seemingly wasted electricity? What does
Proof-of-Work mining really provide?
We've already alluded to a kind of *trust* that this process produces,
a guarantee sometimes referred to as *thermodynamic immutability*. 
It means that the integrity of the historical record produced by the Bitcoin
blockchain (i.e. it's immutability), is guaranteed by the thermodynamics of the universe,
rather than the whims of our social politics.

It is often said that history is written by the victors,
where victory is defined in terms of war and conquest. In this light the phrase reflects a
sort of defeatist resignation to the perils of political plunder.
But Bitcoin redefines that victory which writes history, not as discriminatory political might, but as a
verifiable, thermodynamic process, at once accessible to all. It casts the
same phrase in a more hopeful light, where history is written not by way of
destructive political wars, but by way of a voluntary, collective, economic game.

As the Bitcoin blockchain marches on, the *cost* of re-writing 
Bitcoin's history increases in proportion to the amount of computing power already spent.
For this reason we talk about Proof-of-Work mining as providing a kind of security.
Some call this kind of security "cryptoeconomic", in reference to the mix of
cryptographic and economic guarantees it provides.

This is not to say social consensus and politics are not involved in Bitcoin or that
Bitcoin is just math and physics. Bitcoin is an evidently political-economic institution
with many sources of trust. But the pumping heart of the Bitcoin network, it's
Proof-of-Work backbone, is a thermodynamic process that provides a kind of guarantee about history ("thermodynamic immutability"),
and a kind of fairness in distribution (a sort of "universal basic job")  that we *do not otherwise know how to produce*. 
What we get from mining is the most
advanced and robust source of trust for international agreement that we've ever
had. And it *only* costs as much as the economy of Switzerland?!  This may prove to be especially important in the coming years amidst what
appears to be increasingly turbulent geopolitical relations. International
sources of agreement are in short supply.

I [like to argue][bitcoin-turns-10] that saying Bitcoin is wasteful is a bit like saying the Sun is
wasteful. Look at how much energy the Sun wastes, and for what?! Of course, the sun
provides a certain kind of guarantee to biological activity on Earth, a robust foundation 
for the development of all the world's ecosystems. I suggest to you that
Bitcoin, and the guarantees it provides, might play the same kind of role in our
evolving digital ecosystem that the Sun plays for life on our planet.

## Mind the Miners

Bitcoin mining gravitates to the cheapest sources of
electricity, but the particulars are nuanced. On the one hand,
there's still cheap coal around, and [miners are firing up old, dirty plants][firing-up-dirty-mining] where they can get away with it. 
This is clearly bad. But on the other hand, renewables are increasingly the cheapest sources of
power all over the world. [Estimates of the carbon neutrality of Bitcoin's mining power][nic-carter-mining]
range from 30-70%. And apparently, El Salvador is planning to mine Bitcoin with [clean energy from volcanoes][volcanos].
But these distributions are by no means static. We've witnessed recently the migration of huge amounts of mining
activity out of China by virtue of the [recent mining bans][china-ban]. Demand for cleaner mining
operations is [apparent and growing][green-bitcoin], as are projects to recycle
heat generated by mining to [warm greenhouses][greenhouse-mining].

Further, the energy grid today *intentionally wastes* huge amounts of energy.
As utility companies struggle to match the supply of produced energy to the demand for it,
they often end up with excess energy that no one can use, energy with nowhere to go - it's just wasted.
This is true especially for solar and wind, which can only produce when the sun
or the wind are present, but it's also true more broadly.
Utility companies may be able to use Bitcoin mining to help stabilize the grid by harbouring this excess, otherwise wasted energy.
Many suggest Bitcoin mining might actually [*improve the viability*][square-renewable-mining] of renewable energy projects themselves
by functioning as a sort of quasi ["battery"][bitcoin-battery] that can store excess electrical energy as financial value, and thus make profitable an otherwise costly
mismatch between supply and demand. 

As for Bitcoin mining hardware, the Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), 
they may be simpler and require less extractive resources than car batteries and general computers, 
but their turnover has been quite substantial, as new, more powerful hardware hits the market every few years.
E-waste in general is a very serious and growing problem globally, seemingly driven
largely by two pathological but related tendencies at the heart of modern capitalism: 
planned obsolescence for consumers and inhibitions on the right-to-repair. The Bitcoin
ASIC industry appears as a brutal caricature of these pathologies - 
each generation of ASICs becomes obsolete as soon as
the next generation hits the market, and they require incredibly highly
specialized production facilities. It's also not at all clear yet how effective recycling is. 
These are all things to worry about. 

But there is also reason to be optimistic. Bitcoin mining, and
computing generally, are coming up against the physical boundaries of
computation as [Moore's Law has started to break down][moores-law], placing limits on the
ability to produce new, faster chips without some kind of serious breakthrough in
physics and computer engineering. This means the innovation must turn
increasingly from speed (smaller transistors, more per chip), to *efficiency*, including more efficient energy usage, cooling,
use of raw materials, etc. As microchip production is already a
highly scarce resource, and priority is anyways given to major companies like
Apple, Qualcomm, etc., Bitcoin ASIC producers have to make do with lower quality
materials and longer delays. 
But In any case, by grounding itself in the most
raw expression of computing capability, Bitcoin may even help to subsidize the production, 
and incentivize the decentralization, of computer chip manufacturing in general. The importance 
of greater, and more decentralized semiconductor production is being made increasingly apparent
by the COVID induced shortage, which is causing all sorts of dislocations
in the supply chain.

One could debate these nuances, around the energy, hardware, and economics of Bitcoin mining, indefinitely.
Some do. The likes of [Nic Carter][nic-carter] making the case for, the likes of 
[David Gerrard][david-gerrard] and [Tim Swanson][tim-swanson] making the case against. 
But the limits to our reason and the dynamic nature of the industry frustrates any sort of final word on the matter. Bitcoin
will ebb and flow, like any great technology, simultaneously threatening both
destruction and salvation of the human species. We have only to ask ourselves,
"Is the game worth the candle?". And in this sense, the world faces much bigger
problems than the energy usage and e-waste of Bitcoin. I think we'd do better to face those problems with
Bitcoin at our back than without.

Bitcoin is no [paper-clip maximizer][paper-clip]. It functions instead as a kind
of lens onto the rest of society. It's core values, of
freedom and self-reliance, censorship-resistance and
verifiability, conservation and security, burn bright
in contrast to the increasingly authoritarian and co-dependent quality of modern society. 

Perhaps Bitcoin could be said to have the same kind of
relationship to the world of semiconductors, energy production, and even
economics as cannabis has had on hydroponics and agricultural technology - 
relative outcasts of a countercultural spirit, injecting massive amounts of R&D to swim between 
the cracks of existing institutions, ultimately transforming those institutions
in the end for the better.


## Big Bad Blockchains

Many people have heard the phrase "blockchains, not Bitcoin", 
meant to express that blockchain technology is a meaningful innovation,
but Bitcoin can be largely ignored. Of course, I don't believe Bitcoin can or
should be ignored. But it is also true, contrary to what many so-called "Bitcoin
Maximalists" might avow, that blockchains, independent of Bitcoin, really are a meaningful
innovation in their own right. Blockchains innovate in the field of fault-tolerant multi-stakeholder databases
and applications, a field which is itself becoming increasingly important as 
we wrestle with the monopoly power of large corporations and the administrative
overhead of more democratic institutions. Blockchains are *tools of coordination*,
tools we can use to improve transparency, verifiability, security, privacy, reconciliation, and
other complex and costly qualities of our social institutions. We should thus look forward to a proliferation of blockchains, 
perhaps on the order of the number of cities, or even the number of companies in
the world, as a foundation for platforms that better represent and serve their stakeholders.

But does every blockchain need to use Proof-of-Work mining like Bitcoin?
Absolutely not! In fact, there is little justification for 
more than a few Proof of Work blockchains, if not just the one.
I've spent much of the last seven years (along with many other talented people) developing and promoting 
an energy efficient alternative to Proof-of-Work called
[Proof-of-Stake][PoS], where the competitive energy guzzling of miners is replaced by the collaborative pledging of *validators*.
Instead of using energy-hungry Proof-of-Work, the integrity of the history
in a Proof-of-Stake blockchain is guaranteed by having validators pledge their coins in a kind of "bond" which can be destroyed if they
try to re-write history. To a large extent, this is what the [Tendermint][tendermint] and [Cosmos][cosmos] projects have been
about. And we've largely succeeded. Pretty much all major blockchains being built today use Proof-of-Stake validators instead
of Proof-of-Work miners, and thus do away with mining and the ridiculous energy
expenditure therein. Many of them are even built using the [Cosmos technology][cosmoscap]. 
There's no real excuse for any *new* blockchain to use mining.
Even Ethereum, which currently uses Proof-of-Work mining and is second only to Bitcoin, 
has begun its transition to Proof-of-Stake. 

Proof-of-Stake, though, is not a panacea. Powerful as it is, it will never be able to provide the same
guarantees as Proof-of-Work, no matter how close it thinks it can
approximate them for practical purposes. And by necessity, Proof-of-Stake
architectures are *much* more complex than Proof-of-Work. Like an order of
magnitude or two more complex. There's a lot to be said about the value and importance of 
simplicity in systems design. Compared to other chains, Bitcoin is also committed to a much slower pace of 
evolution. Some take this as a sign of ossification, as if Bitcoin is dead
technology and cannot evolve. But Bitcoin in its history has managed to rapidly respond to software bugs,
has gone through at least one major upgrade ("Segwit"), and has another upgrade
scheduled this year ("Taproot"). As other chains experiment with more rapid
evolution, Bitcoin remains committed to being a slow and steady backbone for the
much larger ecosystem. Thus while Proof-of-Stake is unequivocally the immediate future of blockchains, 
Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work, and Bitcoin itself, with its greater simplicity and commitment to a more conservative evolution,
is not to be dismissed so quickly. 

But Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake
are also not the end of the story. In my talk on [Stakeholders and Statemachines][stakeholders-and-statemachines],
I propose that Bitcoin is the first stage in a journey towards increasingly representative monetary
institutions, a fractal hierarchy of money that can sustainably [bridge the gap from local self-sufficiency to global
luxuries and back][tweet-crypto-thesis]. That journey leads us from the more
objective, international sources of trust, to the more subjective and local. From
the cryptographically verifiable energy expenditure in a remote data center that
is today's Proof-of-Work, to the communally verifiable delivery of life sustaining care work that is tomorrow's Proof-of-Care and [Proof-of-Plant][proof-of-plant]. 
Proof-of-Stake may be the next step in that journey - somewhat more subjective, less anonymous, more socially aware than Proof-of-Work. 
<!-- PoW has the same problems, right? With more bitcoin you can own more compute, which means you can amass and control more bitcoin? -->
But Proof-of-Stake is riddled with it's own issues, many of which parallel the oligopolistic tendencies of modern finance,
of which we have not the time to address here. What Proof-of-Stake blockchains
do give us today, though, is an environmentally friendly platform on which we can discover and experiment
with new monetary primitives, ways to incentivize, for instance, 
[regenerative agriculture][regen], [cooperative internet service providers][althea],
[mutual credit unions][grassroots], and [local money alternatives][local-money]
more broadly.

## Conclusion

Monetary institutions are not static. They evolve considerably. And they have 
profound effects on the socioeconomic structure of society. Bitcoin's
Proof-of-Work mining provides the most advanced and transparent source of trust for international institutions yet known to our species.
It applies a consistent sort of evolutionary pressure on our institutional forms towards the more verifiable, accessible, and representative - 
that is to say, the more democratic.
It suggests that our international institutions could be grounded, not in
military prowess and colonial conquest, but in our ability to harness energy for
computation. And it suggests a layering, a fractal hierarchy of money, stretching
from the more objective and anonymous work of harnessing electrical energy, to the more communal and self-sustaining work of growing food and caring for each other.
It is on the basis of this more humane foundation that we might expect to build a more sustainable society.
Surely, this is something much better for the world than a capitalistic electric
vehicle manufacturer.
