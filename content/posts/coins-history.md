description: "A short history of metals and coinage in Europe, based on Spufford's Money and its use in Medeival Europe." 
---

The money and coinage of medieval Europe evolved from the fallout of money in
Rome. Names and types of money proliferated, but at least in western Europe
there emerged a general structure and story, captured by the eternal legacy of
the pounds, shilling, and pence. This is a brief account of that
story.[^spufford]

The original terms are the libra, solidus, and denarius, which date back to
Rome. The libra - actually, the *libra pondo* - was a unit of weight, literally,
a "pound by weight". The solidus and denarius were gold and silver coins
respectively. Minting of the silver denarius began circa 200 BC in order to pay
for the Punic Wars, and continued until about 200 AD. The gold solidus only
began to be minted in the early 300 ADs. By then, the denarius had been
debased to copper. There is much more background to Roman coins, essentially
the story of ancient coinage and money. But that's a story for another time.

The coinage of late Rome had no silver - just gold and copper. Copper is less
important to the larger story as copper coins did not become the basis of our
units of account in Europe - the gold and silver coins did. At a point in late
Rome, a gold solidus was worth some 7200 copper coins. A Roman senator could
make 100k-350k solidus per year, and could buy a slave for ~20 solidi. Copper
coins could be used for small day-to-day purchases in the towns.[^soldi]

## The Metals

An essential force behind the evolution of coinage within a state is the
availability of metal, which comes either from having access to a mine, or else
to a trade surplus with another region. The state could also exact payments in
metal from other regions by force or political decree, though this generally
produces less metal than mines and trade, and is generally more unstable. Europe
until the modern era has generally been at a trade deficit with the rest of the
world. There are periods where Europe exports so many slaves that they generate
a surplus (and name a people, the Slavs), but this is an exception. 

Of course there are also two metals - gold and silver - and relative value
between them, which differ between places and times. Europe has long fixated on
a ratio of 1:12, with gold worth 12 times as much as silver. But Europe also has
millennia long history of mining silver, with little gold. Much of the gold has
come from Africa, where the ratio with silver has been much lower, say, 1:6. The
Italians made a habit of accumulating silver from Europe and trading it for
African gold. The history of European money has largely hinged on the
availability to Europe of silver mines, the political capital to exploit them,
and the capacity to convert silver to gold. That is, until the emergence of gold
mining in Europe in the 14th c.

The history of mining gives some structure to the monetary and political history
of Europe. It alternates between periods with access to mines, and periods
without. Successful mines might be reasonably exploited for some ~100 years. The
times with access are boom times. Those without are busts, where bullion famine
can become severe. Both boom and bust can leave lasting impressions on
institutional structure. 

There are 4 major periods of mine exploitation in Europe between Late Rome and
the 16th c. The first three involve silver, and mark eras of important reforms
or "revolutions". The last involves gold, marking its return. Europe had been
without gold for virtually a millennium. The periods are as follows:

- **~600s-800s** - Silver mines in Melle in western France - Charlemagne's
  Reforms, the silver denier, a false dawn of coinage. Rise of feudalism from
  lack of gold
- **960s-1030s** - Silver mines in Goslar in the Harz mountains in Saxony -
  Urban Renaissance, mints and markets come back all across northern
  Europe and England
- **1160s - 1330s** - Silver mines in Germany and Bohemia (Czech) - "Commercial
  Revolution", Fairs of Champagne, International
  English Silver Sterling and Italian Gold Florins
- **1320s - 1400s** - Gold mines in Hungary - Hungarian Florins, English Nobles,
  French Ecus, and the return of gold to Europe at large

Once we know what metal is available when, its easier to follow the history of
the coins.

## Fallout From Rome

Before the Melle mines come into play in the 7th c, we are left in the 5th c,
with the collapse of Roman political authority, no mines, and a decaying
coinage. In England, minting appears to have stopped for some 200
years.[^england-demonetize] The German kingdoms that succeeded Rome - primarily
the Merovingian Franks in "France/Germany" and the Visigoths in "Spain" - tried
to maintain the coinage best they could as minting became increasingly
fragmented and variable across Europe. The silver was non existent, the copper
had mostly disappeared, and the gold was draining out. 

The old Roman solidus continued to be minted, along with a coin 1/3 its size and
value, the trimissis, or triens. As the coinage debased and gold continued to
drain, the solidus itself disappeared in favour of the triens. But the word
"solidus" continued to be used to denominate debt. Except now a solidus did not
mean one solidus coin, since such coins didn't exist anymore. Instead, it meant
three triens coins. The solidus had thus become a unit of account, the triens
its medium of exchange.

By the 7th/8th c, there was such a dearth of gold that Merovingian kings and
lords did not have sufficient gold to pay warriors. So they started paying them
in grants of land, and hence initiated the rise of feudalism as a form of social
organization.[^feudalism] The use of coinage continued to decay.

## Melle, the Franks, and a False Dawn

In the early 7th c, silver is found in Melle (western "France") and a mine
opens.[^melle] The Merovingian Franks restart silver coinage in the form of the
new denier. The triens was still being minted, a gold coin a bit bigger than an
American dime, but now debased to only 1/3  gold. The new denier was modeled
after the triens, but made of silver. Thus, if gold was twelve times as valuable
as silver, the triens would be 12/3 times as valuable - so 4 of the new silver
deniers were worth a triens. Since a solidus is defined as 3 triens, 12 deniers
were worth a solidus. And 240 of these deniers could be cut from a pound weight
of silver.[^triens] Hence the familiar ratio, 1 libra = 20 solidi = 240 deniers
had emerged. 

So here we have the relationship that will define moneys of account throughout
Europe for centuries. That 1 pound, libra, lira, livre was worth 20 solidus,
soldo, sou, shilling, each of which was worth 12 deniers, pennies, pfennigs,
pence. 

When it was first minted, or at least for some time, 240 denier coins were
minted from each pound of weight. This relationship presumably lasted long
enough that the libra would come to _mean_ 240 deniers - the libra became a unit
of account. But mint policies are rarely stable, and coinage generates its own
endogenous instability: as coins are worn from use and reduce in metallic value,
they come to differ from new coins in their content. This difference puts strain
on the declaration that they are one thing ("a denier"), as the fact they can be
distinguished changes how they are used (e.g. hoarding the coins with more metal,
spending those with less). At the same time, those with worn money haven't done
anything wrong, and the king has promised them that a single coin can be used to
settle debts of 1 denier. Why should that promise be broken because there's a
bit less silver?

This is the wedge that opens between a weight and a unit of account - a physical
measure and a legal name. How much value can a name add to a weight, and at what
cost? What's in a promise from the king, and what's it cost him to enforce it?
This is the problem of sovereignty expressed in coinage.

Indeed, mints have often responded to the wear on money by adjusting the
standards of new coins occasionally downwards, to meet the silver content of
the old ones. Meaning more deniers can be made per pound, and more can be
distributed to those involved in minting. Some goes to to run the mint itself
(brassage), some goes to the king (seigniorage), and some goes to whoever trades
their metal for coin. Thus are people incentivized to bring their metal
to the mint, for the king enforces that metal is worth more as coin, and a pound
weight of silver yields more than a pound of account from the mint.

Back to the Merovingians. Their minting had become quite fragmented, with
hundreds of local mints and minimal standardization. Many of them were minting
deniers inscribed with just their location, and no royal authority. Over the
years, the deniers diverged and debased, especially as funds were raised to pay
for war with the Umayyads coming up from "Spain." The number of coins struck
    from a pound weight increased from 240 up to 300.[^merovingians] The libra
    of account, which always meant 240 deniers, had decoupled from the libra of
    weight.

When the Carolingians took power under Pepin the Short, the coinage was
strengthened back to 264 deniers cut from a pound weight. The libra as unit of
account continued to mean 240 deniers, but its value in metal increased or
decreased with the mint policy. When Pepin's son Charlemagne took over, he saw
to it that the coinage was standardized under royal authority across the empire,
and he strengthened it further. Thus did he set a new standard for the quality
of silver coinage in Europe - the _denier carolingienne_, weighing about 1.7g of
silver.[^charlemagne]

This return to silver coinage brought with it a flourishing of a peasant
agricultural economy and a return of markets for peasants to meet and exchange
goods for coin. It also engendered occasional inter-regional markets, like the
Fairs of St Denis, just North of Paris, which seem to arise in the 7th c, and
prosper through the 9th. The silver deniers are the money of the markets, the
money of the fairs.[^st denis] But it was a new money, unlike that of Byzantium
or the old Rome. As Spufford puts it:[^denier-quote]


> When gold coinage had finally disappeared outside Italy, western Europe was
left with a new system of coinage, based on the silver penny, which was entirely
unlike either that which survived in the east, in the Byzantine Empire, or that
which had existed in the later Roman Empire. It was not that the barbarians had
brought something new, and differently Germanic, into the Roman world, for they
had had no coinage of their own, but that a transformation had taken place after
the barbarian peoples were inside the Roman world. The break with antiquity was
not a revolutionary break at a single instant, as when the Germanic peoples
crossed the Rhine frontier in 406, but an evolutionary break, which had taken
more than two centuries to work out. The disappearance of the coinage systems of
antiquity, like the disappearance of the Roman senatorial aristocracy, took many
generations. It was none the less complete.

Ultimately, however, the Melle mines and the Carolingian standard were a false
dawn for coinage in Europe as the mines ran down, the Carolingian dynasty
fractured, and the new currency devalued over the 9th c. This short resurgence
of silver coinage in Europe was dealt its fatal blow by the Vikings, who
basically came to take it all.

With the collapse of Carolinginan political authority, the counts took over
their local mints and minting fragmented again. There is an overall decline in
the use of money. The Vikings, which are extracting payments from kingdoms
across Europe, don't care so much for coinage as such, and treat it all by
weight. Thus does silver come to accumulate in the north.

## Saxon Silver

The real start to coinage in Europe did not come from the Franks or Charlemagne,
though they provided the renewed libra/solidus/denier standard. The real start
came from Saxony, in the north, when in the 960s silver was found in the copper
and lead mines in the Harz mountains near the town of Goslar.[^goslar] The
silver that flowed out of these mines led to an explosion of commercial centers
across Germany and England as mints and markets popped up together across
northern Europe. 

The silver caused a surge in minting in England, which by the late 10th c had
become fully monetized.[^england-monetized] The English maintained such tight
control over their coinage that they began a program of coinage renewal, the
_renovatio monetae_.[^renovatio] Every some years, the entire coinage was recalled and
re-minted. The king collected a tax from the re-minting, and the old coinage was
demonetized. This practice would be later mimicked in eastern Europe. 

By the early 11th c in England and Germany, everyone is using
coins.[^everyone-coins] There is an urban renaissance.[^urban-renaissance] Some
rents and taxes in England and Italy are collected in coin.[^rents] Europe
monetizes. Coin comes to be seen in the north increasingly as currency, not just
weight. Kingdoms of Bohemia, Hungary, Poland, Kiev, Norway accept Christianity
and start minting coins (according to the standards of their Christian
advisers).[^kingdoms] But by the 1030s, the silver from Goslar is on the
decline, and by the later half of the century, the general reduction in coinage
brings about a recession across northern Europe.

At the very end of the 11th c, Europe experiences a new wave of activity
engendered by the crusades. Raising the funds for the crusades was a heroic
feat, perhaps aided by the new silver that had accumulated. But Europe's chronic
trade deficit, and the massive expenses of the crusades, caused this metal to
drain out to Italy and the East.

The silver of Saxony did not seem to make much way into
France.[^france-no-silver] And by the late 11th c, minting fragmented again
across the continent. England and Italian City States manage to maintain strong
centralized control over their mints. But across France and Germany, it becomes
necessary to qualify units of account by location. Charlemagne's common monetary
standard was long lost. The 'period of regional pfennigs' had
begun.[^regional-pfennigs]

## The Silver of the Commercial Revolution

In the 11th and 12th centuries, the coinage continued to diverge. By the early
12th century, Europe was experiencing bullion famine, amplified greatly by the
crusades. But major new sources of silver were about to be discovered in a
series of mines centered around Prague.  It began in the 1160s with Freiberg, or
"free mountain" (alluding to the freedoms granted to the miners), a town set up
in the eastern end of the Holy Roman Empire created to exploit the newfound
silver.  Freiberg was followed by mines in Bohemia to the south-east, at
Jihlava, and then Kutna Hora. Around the same time that this silver was being
found in the Empire and in Bohemia, silver was also being found in Italy, first
in Tuscany, and later and more significantly in Sardinia. Silver was mined more
or less continuously in one region or another from the late 12th c to the early
14th. 

The new silver led to a heyday in feudal coinage. There was so much silver,
every minor baron could run a mint.[^heyday] Amidst the chaos, certain silver
pennies stood out. In 1180 England, King Henry II, who ruled England and eastern
France, established the fine sterling standard with the new short-cross penny.
At 92.5% fine silver, it was less susceptible to wear than finer silver coins,
and yet strong enough to become a widespread standard.[^sterling] Italians would
come to accumulate this sterling at the Champagne fairs,[^italian-sterling] which peaked in the
late 12th/13 century, and presumably benefited substantially from the new silver
boom. The common unit of account of the fairs, the _livre provinois_, was
defined as 240 of the silver _denier provinois_ minted in Provins, in the County
of Champagne. In Paris they were minting the _denier parisis_, and to the
southwest at the Abbey of St Martin at Tours was minted a coin that would soon
become standard across France, the _denier tournois_. Of course both Paris and
Tours had their own _livre_ of account, each worth 240 of their respective
pennies.

Perhaps emboldened by the silver flooding into France, in the late 12th c,
Philip II Augustus styled himself King of France (his predecessors were King of
the Franks), and embarked on a determined project of state building and
centralization. Before going after the English presence in eastern France, he
put aside his differences with Henry II's son Richard I when they teamed up for
the Third Crusade in ~1190. But he would then lead France into several
successful conflicts with Henry II's other son John, who steadily lost his
Kingdom's possessions on the continent. John would famously have to sign the
Magna Carta (1215) to placate the barons back in England. Philip, having come
into possession of Tours, set about making its long admired currency, the _denier
tournois_, the currency of all of France. The denier tournois was fixed at a
rate of 4/5 of the denier parisis, which continued to be minted in Paris for
centuries, until it was finally phased out. The denier provinois continued to be
used in Champagne. But by the end of the 13th c, the French kings were
intervening in Champagne, and the fairs went into decline. Thus did the denier
tournois spread across France.

While silver coinage was having its heyday, ingots of silver, valued by weight,
also saw extensive use as a means of payment. These ingots were measured in a
unit of weight called the mark, and were widely used for larger purchases and
trade across the continent, and with the rest of the world. Different standards
for silvers fineness and definitions of the mark proliferated. Coinage standards
came to be defined in number of coins cut per mark of metal. The mark of
Troyes in the County of Champagne saw centuries of use in France and the Low
Countries.

Meanwhile, the Italians. If the new silver strengthened the kings of France, it
all the more so strengthened the Italian merchants and their city states,
especially when imposed on the new networks of colonization and trade they had
built through the Crusades in Northern Africa, Byzantium, and the Near East.
Silver was crucial fuel for the Crusades. The first 2 crusades, which came
before the new silver, caused metal to drain out of Europe to Italy and to the
East. But armed with new sources of silver, the crusades resumed with fury in
the late 12th c and carried on all through the 13th. We already saw how the
English and French kings put aside their differences to join the Third Crusade
together. With the Fourth Crusade, a new silver coinage arose in Venice that
would soon spread across Europe.

The crusaders were supposed to pay the Venetians some 85k marks of silver (a
unit of weight) for transport in the Fourth Crusade. But the Venetians needed
this silver to be distributed to a large number of people, and doing it with
their small denari would have required minting way too many coins. By now their
denari contained only 0.1g of silver, compared to the English's 1.3g penny, or
Charlemagne's old 1.7g standard. So they made a new "great" coin, the _grossi_, worth
24 of the old denari, and weighing just under 2.2g.[^grossi] The old denari went
on being minted, but came to be known as _piccoli_ for "little ones". Thus a new
tier had been added to the monetary system, a large silver coin minted alongside
a small one. The grossi and denari. The Venetian Grossi also came to be called
"ducat", from the word "dux" on the back (the Venetian gold ducat was still
decades away).

In Italy, coinage was divided by city state, and each city had a unit of account
and coinage that evolved in its own way.  By the early 13th c, every important
Italian city north of Rome is minting ~2g grossi.[^italy-grossi] Minting of
grossi spread across Europe, where it was used for wages and rents, while
deniers went on being used for small purchases and alms. In Tuscany, its grossi
circulated at 12 denari, or 1 soldi.[^tuscan-grossi] Meaning the Tuscan soldi,
which had until now been just a unit of account (worth 12 denari), finally materialized as a large
silver coin. The same thing happened in France, in 1266, with the new silver
_gros tournois_, worth 1 _sous tournois_.[^french-grossi] The _sous tournois_,
which had only ever been a unit of account (worth 12 denier), materialized as its own coin. But
these grossi would not be worth a soldi or a sous for long, as the sous of
account was defined as 12 deniers, and the denier continued to lighten or
debase. Thus the unit of account would devalue, and the value of the grossi in
the unit would be "cried up" as a gros became worth more than 12 deniers.

In certain places, a unit of account would form independently around the grossi,
using it as the new basis - effectively replacing the penny as the basis for the
unit of account. This was the case in Low Countries, where the large silver _groot_ become a
dominant coin, and units of account came to be reckoned in pounds, shilling, and
pfennigs of groot.[^groot] 240 groot coins made up the new groot pound. The
groot had become the new denier.

The Venetians, which invented the grossi in the Fourth Crusade, were also that
Crusades major beneficiary. The 4th crusade culminated in the Sack of
Constantinople, which greatly weakened Byzantium and strengthened Venetian
control over the Mediterranean. The new silver in general helped the Italians
stabilize control over the Mediterranean network, and served as essential fuel
for harnessing that network throughout the 13th c. For the Italians were
everywhere looking to turn silver to gold. 

By the mid 13th c, the balance of trade for the Italians was such that large
amounts of gold were flowing into the northern city states, sufficient for them
to start minting gold currency in Europe for the first time in some 500 years.
To be fair, gold coinage had existed in southern Italy, which was part of
Byzantium, for much of this period. Alas, we will not much cover the Byzantine
or Arab coinage here during this time, despite the major impact its had on the
medieval European coinage we have been discussing (for starters, the design of
the Merovingian deniers was taken from the Umayyad coinage[^merovingian-arab]). 

Within a few months in 1252, both Florence and Genoa started minting a gold
coin.[^florin] They would later come to be joined by Venice with its gold ducat in
1284. For Florence, its florin was initially worth 1 Florentine lira. Thus the
Florentine lira had finally materialized as its own coin. For Genoa, its lira
had not devalued as much as that of Florence, and it's new gold genovino coin
was worth 8 Genoese soldi. These coins are remarkable for the role they came to
play in international trade.

The massive injection of silver led to a resurgence in trade across Europe that
came to be known as the Commercial Revolution, named after the transformation
that occurred in means of commerce, epitomized by the rise of the Italians and
the ways they conducted business. The central pivot of the European commercial
revolution were the Fairs of Champagne, which the Italians had been frequenting
already in the 12th c, but which rose to new importance as a rendezvous point
across all European trade. It was here that new credit instruments, like the
Bills of Exchange, appear to have become more widespread, facilitating the conduct of commerce
from afar. The role of paper in monetary affairs was greatly facilitated by the
arrival of Hindu-Arabic numerals and bookkeeping in Italy, from at least the
time of Fibonacci's great book of 1202, if not earlier. Bookkeeping would also
lead to the rise of deposit banking, providing new means to expand the money
supply on the ledgers of banks. 

The Commercial Revolution saw a separation of roles for merchants, and the
emergence of a new stationary class - merchants who could conduct their business
from afar, without travel. Italian businessmen conducted their business from
home, making ample use of carriers to travel between places with goods and
letters, and of trusted (often family) factors, agents, and correspondents
spread across the cities of Europe to execute transactions on their
behalf.[^stationary-merchants]
Italian pre-eminence in business and monetary matters led them to run mints and
mines across Europe. The growth of their economies allowed them to do import
replacement,[^import-replacement] producing locally things they previously
needed to import. And finally, it opened the gateway for the return to gold in
Europe.

We have focused here on the role of the coins in the commercial revolution - 
the gold coins for long distance trade and the large silver coins providing a new
denomination to facilitate wages and rents. But arguably, the bill of exchange
would have a more significant role than the gold coins for long distance
trade, and deposit banking would have a more significant role in local
circulation than the new silver grossi. Thus the commercial revolution marked
not just the rise of new coinage types, but of a new paper-based system of
banking that within a few centuries would come to transform the way people conceived of and used money.[^paper]
But the history of banking is a story unto itself, a story for another time.


## Victory of Gold

Just as the mining of silver in Europe (now primarily at Kutna Hora, Bohemia)
was about to start running down, in 1320, new gold mines open in Hungary (in
Kremnica, now in Slovakia) that unleash a torrent of gold into Europe. By 1328,
Hungary is minting the first successful gold coin beyond the Alps, a copy of the
florin. So much of this gold was traded for Bohemian silver that the Bohemians
soon followed suit with their own gold coin.[^bohemian-gold] In the same year,
mint reforms in Venice move the city from a silver standard to one based on
gold.[^venice-gold] Across Italy, new units of account emerge based on the new
gold coins.  By 1355, silver grossi are no longer being minted in Venice, and
accounts are now reckoned in lire, soldi and denari _di grossi a oro_ - the
grosso was no longer a real coin, but had dematerialized into a unit of account
worth 1/24 of the real gold ducat. A similar thing happened in Florence, as
their unit of account came to be gold based lire, soldi, and denari
_affiorino_.[^florence-gold]

This re-emergence of gold puts Europe squarely on a bimetallic monetary system.
The relative mint prices of gold and silver in different countries lead to
bullion flows across borders as merchants seek to take advantage of arbitrage
opportunities across mints. France tries to start minting their own gold coins -
the various flavours of _ecu d'or_ - as early as the late 13th c to compete with
the Italians, but they don't take off until the 14th c. Ecu (in Italian,
_scudo_) means "shield", and the different ecus "of gold" that emerge over the
years are named according to the image on their obverse. 

The 1330s see the start of the Hundred Years War, of which the new gold played a
key part. Both Edward III of England and Philip VI of France begin minting their
respective gold coins, the English noble and the French ecu a la chaise.
Philip's ecu a la chaise are originally worth 1 livre
tournois,[^ecu-a-la-chaise] and are used to subsidize his allies in the
Netherlands (they would be cried up over the years as the unit of account
devalued).  Edward also raised significant sums of gold florins from his
Florentine bankers (who he would famously default on), used to pay for his own
allies in the Netherlands.[^nobles] Thus did significant amounts of gold start
to collect in the Low Countries. 

In 1360 John II of France starts minting his _ecu a cheval_, which also comes to be known
as the _franc_.[^franc] It's initially valued at 1 livre tournois, and the
word _franc_ comes to be a synonym for the _livre tournois_, the dominant French
unit of account. These ecus would again come to be cried up as the unit of
account devalued over time. In the late 15th century Louis XI starts minting the
_ecu au soleil_, a variant of _ecu a la couronne_, both of which are named for
the appearance of a sun. 

By the early 16th c, ecus were circulating of which 64, 65, or 66 were cut from a
marc of Troyes. Independent of these coins, but likely inspired by them, a unit of account had emerged for 
use in exchange by bills, the _ecu de marc_, that
was defined as 1/65 of a marc of fine gold. As the ecu au soleil settled for a time at a value of 45
sous tournois (up 2.25x from when an ecu was worth 1 livre, or 20 sous), 
it inspired a new equivalence for the ecu de marc in terms of the french unit of
account. Thus it came to be that 1 ecu de marc would be fixed at 45 sous
tournois.[^ecu-de-marc] 

The ecu de marc served as the basis for the network of exchange by bills,
dominated by Italian exchange bankers who facilitated exchange between units of account across Europe.
And so it was that a crisis of this network in the late 16th century, precipitated by instability in the French unit of account, 
would ultimately lead to the end of the medieval monetary system and to the rise
of a new monetary constitution - that of modernity. But that too is a story for
another time.
