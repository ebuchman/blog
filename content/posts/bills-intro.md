its primary instrument, the bill of exchange."
---

The history of capitalism, in so far as it’s something that emerged out of
developments in Italian bookkeeping, is broadly a history of the *bill of
exchange*. This versatile instrument dominated the financial landscape of the
West for some 800 years, from the First Crusade on the eve of the 12th century
until the First World War at the start of the 20th. Surely, if we are to
understand the emergence of the capitalist system, its history and origins, we
must study the bill of exchange, and the *network of exchange* it enabled. Alas,
even acclaimed accounts of the history of finance and capitalism get basic facts
wrong,[^1] while others pay brief lip-service to the importance of the
bills.[^2]

Fortunately, there is a foundational literature that seeks to unravel the
mystery of the bills.[^3] And PhDs continue to be written to untangle the
records of the medieval Italian bankers who wielded them.[^4] But this
literature is dense, fragmented, and incomplete. The story is only told in
pieces. Many links are missing. As a result, outside the specialized literature,
and perhaps even at times within, confusion tends to abound.

Why should we care about the bills? The bills make up the fabric of the
international banking system, from its emergence in the 12th c to its maturity
in the 20th, before they are finally supplanted (really, gobbled) by central bank mediated markets 
in government debt. The bills, and especially the crisis of the 1570s, 
forms the backdrop for the rise of central banking and the modern monetary constitution. 
One might observe that the 20th century is the culmination of a near millennium long
battle between bills of exchange and government debt instruments - between
financing commerce and financing government. Public finance won. But what have we lost?
Studying the bills offers a way to answer the question. 

The story of the bills is a story of doing more with less, of
reducing the need for money to move, of facilitating balanced credit relations that can net
or "clear" against each other with no money needed. 
The story of public finance is a story of just doing more, of a steady increase in
money, of permanent imbalances. In the world of the bills, the best money is the
money that didn't need to appear at all (the bills clear). In the world of
public finance, the best money is the liabilities of the central bank. 

So where did all these banks come from? We predominantly think of banks as 
institutions of *credit*, but the origin of banking is in *exchange*. The word
banking comes from the Italian *banco*, the tables at which certain merchants sat where they offered to exchange different
currencies. These merchants were the *bancheri* (the bankers). We'd call them
*money changers*. The same phenomenon goes back to ancient Greece, their words *trapezai* (table) and *trapezitai* (banker).
Thus the first bankers were those who would swap your coins. Naturally, some people began
leaving their coins with the bankers for safe keeping, and hence the role of
deposit developed, and with it the capacity for bankers to effect payments "on
their books". But the origin of the phenomenon is exchange.

There are really two different types of exchange - local and international. 
Local exchange is done at the benches with small time local firms that deal in coins, deposits, and local
payments. They deal in different monies, **here and now**. But international
exchange is a another story - it's the world of the premier Italian
merchant bankers who facilitated long distance exchange, trading money here and
now for money **elsewhere and later**. This type of banking was much bigger and more complicated business than the local
money changers, requiring international corporate infrastructure and double-entry bookkeeping. 
This was the type of banking that didn't emerge in the ancient world, but came
specifically out of medieval Italy. These international firms came to dominate the world of
money and finance. And their instrument? The bill of exchange.

In later posts we'll get into the details of what the bill of exchange actually
was, though this changed significantly over time.
Because of its international nature, it was both an instrument of 
exchange (across space), and a granting of credit (across time). 
In its simplest and earliest form it was a way for a merchant to borrow from a banker in one place (say
Genoa, denominated in Genoese money) and to repay in another place (say Champagne, denominated in the money of Champagne). 
But it also came to be used by exporters to collect on payments owed to them
from importers abroad. In the first case the merchant was borrowing to expand his balance
sheet and pursue new business. But in the second case he's not really borrowing, 
he's just trying to get paid for old business by selling the money already owed to him abroad.  

This difference is the source of a great deal of confusion in the literature
regarding which "direction" the bill went, namely, whether it was really a *bill* 
(issued by an existing creditor, like an exporter, saying "you owe me,
here's the bill") or a *note* (issued by a debtor, "i owe you"). In both cases the merchant drawing the bill gives it 
to a banker in exchange for local money. But the distinction is important
because it reflects a difference in where the credit actually originates and how
the credit extension is managed in the banking system. As we'll see, unlike
bills, notes can circulate more easily, and unlike notes, bills can "hide" the potentially 
blasphemous credit nature of the instrument (lending with interest was mostly illegal for much
of this period, but exchange was not).

The problem is that what we call bills of exchange through history sometimes appear to go one way, and sometimes the other. 
My thesis is that the archetypal *polarity* actually
did reverse, and it did so twice, over the long near millennium of its life,
from note to bill and back again.[^polarity] These polarity reversals occurred, roughly speaking, around 1300 and 1600, and
they carve the history into three broad epochs, between which the function of
the bill of exchange, and the wider exchange network it supported, was materially distinct.
Each epoch is further separated by a transition period marked by a great crisis,
which transformed the political and economic environment.

Studying the bills thus allows us to understand the broader structure of the
history of finance and capitalism, and how it evolved over these three major
phases. In the first phase, the early period, ~1100-1300, what’s referred to as a “bill of exchange” was actually a note, a
promise to pay by a debtor. And it was primarily an instrument designed for use
with a trade fair, most notably the Fairs of Champagne, where the payment was
actually due. These notes were formally notarized and non-transferable.
I suggest that the primary purpose of this instrument was
for Italians to *fetch silver home from Champagne*. This period was indeed
marked by a flood of new silver from mines across Europe. The period culminates
in the crisis of the 1290s.

In the second phase, the classical period, ~1300-1600, the bill of exchange was
more properly a bill, at least in its archetypal form - it’s an order to pay,
issued by a creditor, to a correspondent abroad that owes him money. As we’ll
see it’s more flexible than this, but this archetypal form gave the network a
distinct purpose from that of the first period. The bill was still non-transferable, but 
it's no longer notarized. One could say these instruments enabled complex and
mature management of liquidity across the network of bankers, but they were not liquid ("negotiable") in themselves. 
Their primary purpose appears to have been to enable a new kind of international
corporation to systematically profit by perpetually “*running balances on exchange*”, even in the absence of
a great fair or the movement of silver. Indeed, the period is marked by a major
shortage of silver (until it pours in from the New World). 
Central fairs did return in the 15th c, climaxing in 16th c Lyons, but the
rise of continuous exchange centers like London, Bruges, Paris, Avignon, etc.
outside the cycle of the fairs gave the exchange network a very different
flavour. The Spanish silver influx ultimately seems to have destroyed the system
in the crisis of the 1570s. Out of its ashes rose the Central Banks and a new
kind of money market.

In the third phase, the later period of ~1600-1900, the bill again
came to resemble a note, a pledge by a debtor to pay. This transformation
developed as bills became *negotiable*, in that they could be accepted by multiple
parties, who agreed to be liable for them. Chains of acceptances gave the bills
the ability to circulate as, basically, notes, promises to pay by their issuer
(in this case, anyone who had accepted it!). 
Thus they became liquid in their own right, giving rise to discounting markets,
where merchants could buy bills at a discount before they're due, earning the
discount as yield. Notably, in this period, 
the bills also lost the quality of exchange, being denominated in a single currency. That they
were still called bills of exchange, even as they came to resemble notes and to
lose any element of exchange, is indeed a major source of confusion about their
history and operation. This is also the period during which their use was liberated from the
monopolization by Italian merchant bankers during a long transition through
Antwerp and Amsterdam, pulling silver in from the new world and ultimately
landing in London. In London, their primary purpose became to finance the slave
trade and the investment capital represented therein. It was in this context
that Central Banks grew up, in the discount market for bills of exchange.
The system came to a globally devastating end in the First World War, out of which the bills never
recovered. The bills retreated into the world of trade financing and invoice
factoring, and government debt swallowed the banking system. 

One important historical undercurrent through all this is the Church doctrine on usury,
which, in its most basic form, made it illegal to issue interest-bearing notes (and thus also made discounting illegal). 
The usury doctrine is best understood as a kind of financial regulation that varied by time and place, 
and had a real effect on institutional structures, despite everyone seeking to overcome it (think tax
regulation and tax planning today). Notably, Church doctrine on usury strengthens ~1300, 
and weakens ~1600, in broad alignment with our periods. Many scholars have emphasized the
extent to which the archetypal bill of our classical period is decidedly legal
and yet able to disguise usurious transactions in numerous ways. One might
suppose that what we are seeing is the emergence of a formal credit instrument
first as a note, then its temporary disguise as a bill for 300 years under
pressure from the Church, and finally its re-emergence as a note once the
Church’s prohibitions are relieved. And indeed, this is a part of the story, but
it's also too simplistic. The Church was already strengthening usury
prohibitions in the 1100s, and the earliest instruments already seem to be
trying to conceal interest. It's certainly true that the Protestant Reformation and
the great weaking of usury laws ~1600 enabled the bills to become notes again.
But the epochs themselves also seem to be marked by
distinct material conditions that were independent of Church usury doctrine - in
particular, the availability of silver - and the form of the bill served
primarily a function in relation to those material conditions. That said, as we
will see, the Church’s role as a *participant* in the system, a remitter of
funds from foreign realms to the papal treasury, and a receiver of actual
precious metal, plays a critical role in the system's evolution. Indeed, 
it might even appear that the entire purpose of the international exchange system 
in the classical period was to finance the Church.

Before wrapping up this intro, a word about money. For much of this history,
money was precious metal, either in bullion or physical coins. And the entire
story of the bills is one anchored in the dynamics of this precious metal money,
yet structured so as to eliminate as much as possible the need for it. Moving
metal is expensive, moving paper is cheap. The bankers of the 16th c and earlier managed 
to facilitate huge volumes of trade with little to
no money at all, without any central repositories of collateral or reserve. It
was when they got too tied up in the problems of financing government that their
system was usurped by government run central banks in the 17th c. The first great
innovation of these new banks was to issue a new kind of credit backed by a centralized reserve of precious metal.
Their second great innovation was to eliminate the need for the metal all together.

This problem of where money comes from is central to the structure of society.
It's part of the constitution. Money is how we account for the world and
denominate value. Today we take for granted that money comes from banks and
central banks, whatever that means. But we're also currently witnessing a historic
re-valuation in the precious metals, with significant demand from central banks. 
The structure of the monetary system is changing. In all likelihood, the metals matter again.
In all likelihood, crypto matters too. Exactly how is anyone's guess. Perhaps
the past is a useful guide.

Thus we wish to explore this history, of that 800 year dance between the financing
of trade and the financing of sovereigns, told through the
eyes of the instrument that lubricated it all, the bill of exchange.

  exchange on page 6 gets one of the basic terms wrong, and his setup is
  anachronistic. I believe I [figured
  out](https://x.com/drumm_colin/status/1985047614547435778) where he got the error from (a typo in
  the 18th c merchant manual he cites). But the rest of his book (cited over 1300 times) otherwise ignores the bills.
  Colin Drumm [sought to clean up](https://trialofthepyx.substack.com/p/bills-of-exchange-medieval-and-modern) 
  some of the confusion around bills a few years ago. That effort continues in
  my own work.

[^2]: Ellen Meiksins Wood, *The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View*. Wood
  mentions the bills briefly in passing, seeming to imply they are primarily a
  British innovation (they're not). She otherwise dismisses the role of finance
  in the development of capitalism. For her, capitalism arose entirely from
  particular conditions in the British countryside that forced tenant farmers to
  innovate to pay rent. The book is cited over 2500 times. Important omissions
  from her story are glaring.

[^3]: Payton Usher's Magnum Opus, *The Early History of Deposit Banking in the Mediteranean* (1943) laid the foundation
for a proper study of the history of banking. His student Raymond de Roover had
    a prolific few decades uncovering mysteries of the bills of exchange, early
    double entry bookkeeping, the markets of Bruges, and the secret books of the Medici.
    Robert Lopez popularized the notion of the Commercial Revolution of the 13th
    century. John Munro took up the study of the bills and early financial
    instruments. Last but not least, a remarkable book, 
    *Private Money and Public Currencies: The Sixteenth Century Challenge*, unravelled the full mystery of the bills of exchange 
    and the international network of exchange they enabled at its climax in the
    16th c, but the book is unnecessarily difficult. I hope to offer a clear summarization in a later
    post.

[^4]: See Nadia Matringe's corpus of work, and Tommaso Brollo's recent thesis, *The banco Capponi in Florence and at the
  fairs of Lyon and Besançon, 1553-1584*. 

[^polarity]: While specialists in the history of the bills are generally aware that something like these polarity reversals have
  taken place, they tend to de-emphasize them (especially the first one). 
  I think this has led to unnecessary confusion, and a misunderstanding of certain key
  features of the exchange network at different times. The
  transition around ~1600 is primarily studied in terms of the development of
  the legal regime of "negotiability" and the rise of discounting.
