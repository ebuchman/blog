or limit working hours. But while Hayek might leave production to be organized by an abstract entrepreneur,

footnote to laisez-faire paragraph
Later in his life, however, Hayek would publish "Denationalization of
Money," where he explored the provision of money by the private sector, a school of thought that would 
inspire Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency movement.




monopoly as cancer

His 1945 paper, "The Use of Knowledge in Society", would expand
on the notion, and is widely considered to be the founding article of a more information theoretic, and
complexity-oriented, economics. The Road to Serfdom shows how 


On these grounds, Hayek thus argues for the importance of market forces and
competition in surfacing the necessary information to make decisions and
organize production in more decentralizated fashion. He advocates a role for
the state in establishing institutions that support competitive processes.

The two political economists also appear to be in agreement on a number of theoretical points, though
they frame them and arrive at them from different angles. Both seem to argue for:
local markets and decision-making; social institutions that 
better represent the structure of society; the gradual evolution of institutions;
and the critical role of the legal system in economics. 

Polanyi argues that the construction of this great fiction - the international
commodification of Land, Labour, and Money - was a concerted institutional design
effort throughout the early 19th century that produced a Great
Transformation: the birth of Market Society.

CONCLUSION
...


- under feudalism/guilds, land and labour part of social organization itself
  (money not a major element of industry ). mercantilism unified this throughout
  country. mercantilism never tried to make labour/land part of commerce
- feudalist privilege (guilds) abolished end of 1700s. no free market of labour
  discussed until end of 1700s
- "A self-regulating market demands nothing less than the institutional
  separaation of society into an economic and a political sphere" - "normally,
  the economic order is merely a function of the social order"
- with coming of elaborate/specific machinery and plants the relationship
  between merchant and production changed.  now involves long term investment
  and risks.

- 
- transition to market economy 1834-~1844 - free market in labour. land/money
  already commoditized. capitalism without free labour failed terribly
- market economy: 1834-1870s
- 1870s: trade unions

- 1776, Adam Smith reflecting mood of quiet progress. Townsend 10 years layer
already conscious of a groundswell of poor
- "Out of the horrors of Speenhamland men rushed blindly for the shelter of a utopian market society"

Smith marked end of an age that started with inventors of the state - Thomas
More, Machiavelli, Luther, Calvin
Smith invented economics by treating material wealth as field of study. but
wealth was still merely an aspect of life of the community, remained
subordinate. Economic sphere not yet subject to laws of its own 


Discovery of economics an astounding revelation, hasted greatly the
transformation of soceity and establishment of market system. not natural but
social sciences as intellectual parents of mechanical revolution subjecting
powers of nature to man

foundations of econ theory laid down during Speenhamland, making appear as
competitive market economy what was actually capitalism without a labour market.
consequences

reintegration of society into human world became aim of social thought. Marx a
failed attempt to do that (too close adherence to Ricardo and liberal econ)

"One man alone perceived the meaning of the ordeal - no thinker ever advanced
father into the realm of industrial society than did [[Robert Owen]]. Aware of
distinction between society and state. no prejudice against latter. looked to
state merely for that which it could perform: helpful intervention designed to
avert harm from the community, emphatically not the organizing of society"

- double movement. economic liberalism aims to establish self regulating market.
  social protection aims to conserve man, nature, and productive organization
- two vital functions of society - political and economic - used/absued as
  weaponsin struggle for sectional interest. 20th century fascism came out of
  this deadlock.


  to Physiocrats, laissez faire was just free export of grain for better farmer
  incomes, really just freedom from regulation in production. not full blown
  Market Society. freedom from regulation in production, not exchange!


- role of gov to slow rate of change. time for adjustment (mcluhan?)
- ps: mcluhan loved polanyi

- economy submerged in society. econ systems runs on non econ motives. social
  anthro, max weber, cant dismiss primitibve econ. changelessness of man as social being
    - absence of motive of gain in primitive society
    - importance of "redistribution" in past. origin of moeny ... reciprocity.
      self sufficiency( house holding, origin of econ!) !
- all known economic systems up to end of feudalism organized on some combination
of reciprocity, redistribution, and householding. no motive of gain.
insititunioal patterns prevailed over markets until end of middle ages. 
markets more important from 16th cent on but didnt control society till 19th
- tradition as limits of uncertainty


1830s and 1840s saw major repeals of restrictive regultions an enormous increase
in admin functions of the state now with central bureaucracy to fulfil tasks set
by adherents of liberalism
just like machinery increased uses of labour, free markets increased need for
control/regulation/intervention
but another paradox. laissez-fair economy was product of deliberate state action
but subsequent restrions started in spontaneous way! **__"Laissez-faire was
planned; planning was not"__**

!

Liberal argument always that "pure" liberalism never tried. the social reactions
always interfered. claim there was an anti liberal conspiracy. but there wasn't,
it was natural reaction of social interests to preotect themselves from
expanding market mechanism

anthropological research shows the goals for which individuals will work are
culturally determined, not purely economic

commoditzation of labour and land liquidates existing cultural institutions

famine was checked under feudalsim by noblesse oblige, clan solidarity,
regulation. but in the market system starvation emerged. in India under East
India Company famine was kept in check by monopolists. bbut under free and equal
exchange Indians perished by the millions

commoditization of land, labour, and money threatened nature, man, and
productive organization. each dealt with in next chapters

Market and Man:
- absence of threat of individual starvation that makes primitive society more
  humane than market economy, and less economic. white man's initial
  contirbution to black man's world consisted in introducing him to the uses of
  the scourge of hunger
- Owen. Coops. social approach. refused to accept division of society into
  political and economic spheres


polanyi - econ as representing social relations
polanyi: 19th cent based distinctly on economic foundation of self-regulating market which implied individual pursuit of gain as sole sufficient force for organizing all society. no room for political coordination.

- great transformation was the kind of rapid institutional change hayek warned about.

as the basis for a sustainable society.

Ostrom's polycentric governance models 


Out of Polanyi's work would emerge a flourishing discipline of
economic sociology. And Hayek, 

## Conclusion



Owenism gave birth to the first successful producer cooperatives, 


Villages of Cooperation, effectively producer cooperatives that sought to
relieve the poor, 

Polanyi remarks that the impetus of Owen's producer coops was lost 


And we get some glimpse, through his praise of Robert Owen,
and through his contributions to the Socialist Calculation debate 20 years
prior, as to his ideal social structure



OUTLINE
- hayek socialist thought devours by disrespecting individual.
- hayek on limits of democratic planning
- hayek on rule of law. polanyi agrees. respect non conforming
- polanyi on need for regulation to get us out of this mess. preserve what we
  can from market society.
- polanyi feudalism as proto coop
- loss of producer coops as defeat
- institutionalism, buchanan, ostrom and polycentricity




- feudalism as proto coops
- capitalism introduced hunger
- laissez fair and the labour market (was just freedom from interference in
  production for the physiocrats)
- competition leads to monopoly!
- so economic liberalism goes from academic interest to boundless activism
- same for international free trade. England would come to depend for food
  supply on overseas sources 
- "road to the free market was opened and kept open by an enormous increase in
  continuos, centrally organized and controllled interventionism"
- reject static class theory. classes always changing
- so the protective movement is grouped not around class interests, but around
  social interests imperilled by the market0 
- owen, coops, labour exchange. offshoot was consumer coops. but loss of
  producer coop was "greatest single defeat of spiritual forces in the history
  of industrial England"


??? never in history were goods of every day life bought and sold ? 

"with free trade, new and tremendous hazards of planetary interdependence sprang
into being" 

(pg 195) market system allergic to rioting. Tudors depended on riots to call
attention to local complaints. financial markets killed rioting. 

when social structure broke down in 1920s in central europe,  working class
alone available to maintain things. thus everywhere power thrust upon trade
unions and social democratic parties. 
peasentry determined economic policy where they normally played a modest role.
now only class available to maintain law and order 

Mises said sovereighty was ridiculous illusion - all unaware of essential nature
of problem of politics

Problem of autarchy haunted market economy from start. econ liberals exorcised
specter of war naively based on assumptin of indestructible market economy

two wings of reaction to market economy - working class (social legislation,
factory laws) and peasantry (agrarian tariffs and land laws). in emergency, the
latter would side with markets, which working-class policies endangered

"The one consistent adherent of the pure gold standard who actually advocated
this desperate step [to relinquish central banking] was [[Ludwig von Mises]];
his advice, had it been heeded, would have transformed national economies into a
heap of ruins"

(pg 205) but separation between econ/politics never truly complete. states ran
mints and guaranteed value of coins by accepting for taxes. "this money was
*not* a MoE, it was a means of payment; it was not a commodity, it was
purchasing power; far from having utility itself, it was merely a counter
embodying a quantified claim to things that would be purchased." clearly society
based on this was not market economy!

purchasing power theory overtook commodity theory in 20th cent   

Discovery of economics an astounding revelation, hasted greatly the
transformation of soceity and establishment of market system. not natural but
social sciences as intellectual parents of mechanical revolution subjecting
powers of nature to man

foundations of econ theory laid down during Speenhamland, making appear as
