description: "Growth and Waste are two sides of the same thermodynamic phenomenon 
and must be understood as such in order to formulate a coherent economics."

Modern economics is predicated on the idea of growth: a healthy economy is a growing economy. 
But it doesn't actually seem to contain an understanding of what growth really is, where it comes from, and, perhaps most importantly, 
what lurks in its shadows: waste.

The flipside of growth is waste. This is a basic fact of the thermodynamics of the universe. All non-equilibrium systems dissipate.
Growth is by definition a non-equilibrium process. Hence it must be dissipating. But economics largely ignores the form of this dissipation. 
Or it bundles it up as "externalities" and tries to price it. But dissipation is a part of thermodynamic reality. It can be understood 
by the discipline of thermodynamics. We cannot understand growth if we don't understand waste. 

It's no surprise to people that we have terrible definitions of growth. That GDP is a scam measure. 
That our current trajectory of infinite exponential growth will imperil the planet. 
But what are we to do about it? There is a degrowth movement, but many are terrified of it. 
And perhaps rightly so. Degrowth sounds an awful lot like *death*. But what if we could look to thermodynamics to realign our 
understanding of growth *and* waste and formulate a more sustainable economics?

By thermodynamics here I mean the broad science of energy, work, dissipation, and information. Its foundations are non-equilibrium 
statistical mechanics, and its most advanced formulation is perhaps found in the field of theoretical ecology. 
It is a science of how *energy* flows through systems; how it performs *work* as it flows; how it *dissipates*
heat as it transforms from one kind of energy to another; and how the flow of energy represents *information* 
about the forces that drive it.

If we want to understand growth on a finite planet we need look no further than life itself. What are the thermodynamic properties of living systems?
This is a foundational question for economics. Living systems are the quintissential far-from-equilibrium sustainable systems. 
They are driven out of equilibrium by dynamic forces in their environment -
primarily, sunlight, and the geochemistry of Earth.
They stabilize themselves by representing those forces internally, so that they can respond effectively to them. 
This internal representation of external forces is the key to sustainability.

## Simple Systems

Simple systems contain little to no representation about their environment. For instance, a cooling cup of tea.
It is driven out of equilibrium when the water is first boiled. But then it dissipates all that energy over time,
settling into equilibrium with the rest of the room.
This kind of dissipation is the foundational force of thermodynamics that drives so much of the macroscopic activity in our universe. 
It is the arrow of time itself:

TODO Cup of tea

The water vapours form fantastic, chaotic patterns as it dissipates the
temperate gradient between the cup of tea and the rest of the room.. 
But the patterns in the vapour contain little information about the environment. 
There is not much information to be had anyways, beyond the difference between the temperature of the tea and that of the room. 

This dissipation phenomenon is best known as the "increase of entropy" or, more
precisely, the [Second Law of Thermodynamics], vaguely understood as "entropy
must always increase". The essential problem of life, then, is how we get
systems to spontaneously organize themselves into *low entropy* ("organized") states, and to
grow those states, in world that is allegedly always trying to dissipate them away?

## Dissipative Systems

The crux of the answer is that lower entropy ("organized") structures spontaneously emerge in
the universe as they are *better able to dissipate energy gradients* than 
alternative, higher entropy ("disorganized") structures. The most primitive
example of this is a convection oven. By establishing a high enough temperature
gradient in your oven (bottom hotter than top), the air in the oven will
spontaneously transform from a linear distribution of temperatures to a cyclical
pattern, where air rises and falls in convection cycles. 

Naturally, this spontaneous emergence of order is only possible after a certain amount of energy has been stored up in the system.
But at some point, that stored energy is used spontaneously to organize the system into a structure that is better able to dissipate 
the energy gradient driving it. This is the secret to reconciling emergent
phenomenon, and the living systems themselves, with the second law on
thermodynamics. It's also essential to understanding how growth is predicated on waste.

These spontaneously emerging cycles appear to us in another, similar form: the vortices of hurricanes and tornado.

TODO: Hurricanes

These are classic dissipative systems. 
All non-equilibrium systems exposed to the environment are effectively dissipative systems. 
But while our hot cup of tea will quickly cool down, 
retiring to equilibrium with the room temperature, these vortices persist in a
"stable" non-equilibrium state, so long as the energy gradients that drive them
remain.

- rainbow and the worm pic
- only "acceleration". no representation of "boundaries"

## Living Systems

TODO
- rainbow and the worm pic
- represent boundaries
- succession, climax forest

## Economies

TODO
- Economies as living systems
- organized as tornados vs organisms
- drive for more representation in the state machine
- growth through concentric layering. recycle waste and orient around honest dissipation
