Earlier this year, Tesla purchased $1.5B worth of BTC to hold on its balance
sheet. This seems to have made a lot of people angry, or at least
confused, including Elon Musk himself.
Tesla, a bastion of our clean energy future, is helping us transition
from fossil fuels to electricity.
Bitcoin, a speculative digital asset, is using more energy 
than Switzerland and is largely powered by Chinese coal. 
What gives?

At the time, [I suggested][tweet-bitcoin-tesla] that Bitcoin might actually be better for the
environment than Tesla. On the surface, this seems absurd. 
But our world and socioeconomy is a complex and
dynamic place. Our environmental impact cannot be denominated purely in carbon
emissions. Yes, we need cleaner sources of energy. Obviously. But our economy
is also grounded in obscene assumptions about indefinite exponential growth on a
finite planet. Simply adopting a cleaner source of energy doesn't actually
help us there. We still consume and dispose of all kinds of materials at unsustainable levels,
and we prioritize abstract "economic growth" over biodiversity and human well
being. We're going to need deeper structural changes to our economic
system if we actually want to get serious about sustainability. Tesla is not
helping bring about those changes. Bitcoin might be.

## Green Tech

Tesla helps entrench and exacerbate a number of existing problems in the world.

One is American capitalism itself. There are obviously good ideas at the heart
of American capitalism, about entrepreneurship and the power of mutually
beneficial exchange to drive progress. But the modern incarnation of military-industrial,
monopolistic, American consumerism is not particularly nurturing for a sustainable future. 
Tesla is perhaps the peak of American capitalism's splendor.

Two is the supply chain of modern technology.
The mining industry, for metals like Lithium, Coltan, and more,
is [riddled with environmental and human rights abuses][supply-chain].
These are not so much measured in carbon emissions (though there are plenty)
as in pollution and destruction of natural habitats and social relationships.
And a car battery requires many orders of magnitude more Lithium than your Macbook. 
Clean energy has a very dirty supply chain, and little incentive to improve it.

Third is cars themselves. The complete centrality of cars in the
organization of urban life is one of the great tragedies
of our time. Sustainability is intimately bound up with how we organize ourselves
on the surface of the planet. Cars, electric or otherwise, are not
particularly conducive to the more human-scale and bio-diverse patterns that are 
critical to sustainability. To the extent we have cars they should probably be electric. 
But more than anything, we need less cars. Denmark has the right idea. As does
everyone who's ever gotten a street closed to cars, for any duration. Respect.

Now I'm not trying to diss Tesla, per se. 
Tesla is the beacon of a research and development process that is itself critical to
sustainability. And if we want to make progress in batteries, which we should, cars are a great
way to go. But the fundamental problems we're facing today don't seem so much technical as they
do political economic. More R&D in capitalist companies with dirty supply chains
feeding conspicuous consumerism can only help so much.

## Orange Money

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a different kind of a thing altogether.
Yes, Bitcoin is being exploited by American capitalism. Yes, Bitcoin mining
hardware inherits the same dirty tech supply chain. And Yes, Bitcoin uses an
extreme amount of energy. But as far as agents of structural institutional
change at the global level for a more sustainable civilization go? Bitcoin might 
be the best thing we've ever seen.

That's a pretty bold statement. And I don't expect to fully convince you here. 
I merely intend to suggest that it's worth thinking about. Bitcoin is
taking its seat at the table of international monetary institutions.
Its market capitalization today (~$0.65T), is larger than *every one* of the major American
banks and payments companies. It's also larger than most of the world's national
currencies, and nearly half that of silver's. Bitcoin is even set to become legal tender in El Salvador later this year, 
and is under consideration for legal tender status in a number of other South American countries.

But Bitcoin isn't a precious metal. And it's not something produced by a company, nor a government, 
nor really any distinctly identifiable organization.
Bitcoin is a collective. An open-source, verifiable, transparent, decentralized, 
collective hosting a store of value and a medium of exchange for all to use on
equal terms without discrimination. Isn't that the kind of stuff that sustainable human institutions
are made of ?

As a collective, Bitcoin shares more of its
character with religion than with enterprise, more with performance art than
with industrial production. This is true of all money: 
it is the materialized mythology of a society's roots and values, its fruits and
dreams. It is a means to bind society in a coordinated web of promises and their redemption.
And Bitcoin is [good art][epsilon-theory-bitcoin].
The dollar, which has since been captured, corrupted, and calcified, was perhaps once
good art too.

Like any monetary institution, Bitcoin is designed to nurture a kind of *trust*
among the society it serves. But it does so in a very different way from the
monetary institutions of the nation states. 
Many of the problems we face today, of inequality and sustainability, can be traced back to the institutions of money. 
How is money created? Who is it distributed to? What is it distributed
for? Modern institutions of money have become enormously extractive and rent-seeking. 
They have brought about a tectonic decoupling between financial activity
and the real socioeconomic activity of the human and natural world. 
Modern finance is notorious for its inherent instability and fragility,
for fuelling unsustainable speculative fires, for exacerbating income inequality,
for failing to adequately support essential labour and services in its value system.
The monetary institutions of the nation states are intimately bound up in the mayhem 
wrought by the global financial system - they have thus dramatically betrayed the trust of the societies they serve.

At least some of this appears due to a collapse in the literal values of money as a
representative media. Unmoored from any real world process, 
modern money multiplies monstrously under the machinations of central bankers.
Its creation and distribution cease to represent any meaningful or socially
valuable information in the real world. As a device for transmitting value
judgements, it thus becomes increasingly faulty. Modern Monetary
Theorists will have you believe that they can rejuvenate the values of money by moving the printing press from the central bank to congress - 
but [I have my reservations](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/mmt/).
Insofar as [sustainable systems are those with sound representations of their environment within their own structure](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/2019-01-20-economic-organisms/),
our modern monetary systems are inherently unsustainable.

Bitcoin is the first, and so far most credible, attempt to challenge the current
paradigm, to meaningfully innovate internationally in the basic values of money.
Yes, it manifests largely as a speculative asset right now. 
But Bitcoin provides a new source of *trust* for international monetary institutions
that is grounded in verifiable physical reality, in the thermodynamics of computation.
While not perfect by any means (nothing is!), Bitcoin anchors a new generation
of monetary institutions in one of the most fundamental physical processes underlying our civilization.

But Bitcoin is not alone the solution to the world's monetary problems. 
It may be necessary, but certainly not sufficient.
Bitcoin proves the potential of money whose issuance and distribution are based on the performance 
of activity deemed socially valuable by the network participants themselves. In the
case of Bitcoin, that activity is the energy intensive Proof-of-Work mining. But Bitcoin
is just the first stage in a journey towards increasingly representative monetary
systems that sustainably [bridge the gap from local self-sufficiency to global
luxuries and back][tweet-crypto-thesis]. 

## Mind the Mining

Bitcoin are created and issued to those who provably contribute to
the security of the Bitcoin network via Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining.
Proof-of-Work entails a specific kind of cryptographic computation resembling
a numerical puzzle that is difficult to solve but easy to verify. If
computing power were evenly distributed throughout humanity (which of course
it's not and could never be), Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work mining would be a sort of Universal Basic Job, 
providing income to anyone who ran a Bitcoin miner.
The energy used would be stable and proportional to human population. 

Of course in the real world, Bitcoin mining is a highly specialized economic
game played out in transistor sizes and electricity sources. 
Smaller, faster chips; cheaper, denser energy. 

Bitcoin mining gravitates to the cheapest sources of
electricity, but the particulars are nuanced. On the one hand,
there's still cheap electricity in Chinese coal, and miners are firing up old, dirty plants where they can get away with it. 
This is clearly bad. But on the other hand, renewables are increasingly the cheapest sources of
power all over the world. [Estimates of the carbon neutrality of Bitcoin's mining power][nic-carter-mining]
range from 30-70%. But these distributions are by no means static. We're witnessing today the migration of huge amounts of mining
activity out of China by virtue of the [recent mining bans][china-ban]. Demand for cleaner mining
operations is [apparent and growing][green-bitcoin]. 

Further, the energy grid today *intentionally wastes* huge amounts of energy.
As utility companies struggle to match the supply of produced energy to the demand for it,
they often end up with excess energy that no one can use and that has no where to go - it's just wasted.
This is true especially for solar and wind, which can only produce when the sun
or the wind are present, but it's also true more broadly.
Bitcoin miners are increasingly showing up to harbour this excess, otherwise
wasted energy. In this way,  Bitcoin mining may actually  [*improve the viability*][square-renewable-mining] of renewable energy projects themselves
by functioning as a sort of "battery" that can store excess electrical energy as financial value, and thus make profitable an otherwise costly
mismatch between supply and demand.

As for Bitcoin mining hardware, the Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), 
they may be simpler and require less extractive resources than car batteries and general computers, 
but their turnover has been quite substantial, as new, more powerful hardware hits the market every few years.
E-waste in general is a very serious and growing problem globally, seemingly driven
largely by two pathological but related tendencies at the heart of modern capitalism: 
planned obsolescence for consumers and inhibitions on the right-to-repair. The Bitcoin
ASIC industry is almost a caricature of this - ASICs become obsolete as soon as
there are more powerful ones on the market and they require incredibly highly
specialized production facilities. It's also not clear yet how effective recycling is.

That said, there is reason to be optimistic. Bitcoin mining, and
computing generally, are coming up against the physical boundaries of
computation as Moore's Law has started to breakdown, [placing limits on the
ability to produce new, faster chips][moores-law] without some kind of serious breakthrough in
physics and computer engineering. This means the innovation must turn
increasingly from speed to *efficiency*, including more efficient energy usage, cooling,
and even use of materials themselves. As microchip production is already a
highly scarce resource, and priority is anyways given to major companies like
Apple, Qualcomm, etc., Bitcoin ASIC producers have to make do with what they can
get their hands on. But In any case, by grounding itself in the most
raw expression of computing capability, Bitcoin may even help to subsidize the production, 
and incentivize the decentralization, of computer chip manufacturing in general. The importance 
of greater, and more decentralized semiconductor production is being made increasingly apparent
by the COVID induced shortage, which is causing all sorts of dislocations
in the supply chain.

One could debate the nuances of Bitcoin mining energy, hardware, and economics indefinitely. 
Some do. The likes of Nic Carter making the case for, the likes of David
Gerrard makes the case against. But the limits to our reason and the dynamic
nature of the industry frustrates any sort of final word on the matter. Bitcoin
will ebb and flow, like any great technology, simultaneously threatening both
destruction and salvation of the human species. We have only to ask ourselves,
"Is the game worth the candle?" But Bitcoin is no [paper-clip
maximizer][paper-clip]. If anything, it appears to have the same kind of
relationship to the world of semiconductors, energy production, and even
economics as cannabis has had on hydroponics and agricultural technology - 
relative outcasts of a countercultural spirit, injecting massive amounts of R&D to swim between 
the cracks of existing institutions, ultimately transforming those institutions
in the end for the better.

## In Proof we Trust

For years now, the Bitcoin mining network has been the world's largest supercomputer,
more powerful than all the other supercomputers combined, though it is computing only a single rather simple
function with seemingly little practical value. 
So what do we even get for all this seemingly wasted electricity? What does
Proof-of-Work mining really provide?
We've already alluded to a kind of *trust* that this process produces,
a guarantee sometimes referred to as *thermodynamic immutability*. 
It means that the integrity of the historical record produced by the Bitcoin
blockchain (i.e. it's immutability), is guaranteed by the thermodynamics of the universe,
rather than the whims of politics.

It is often said that history is written by the victors,
where victory is defined in terms of war and conquest. In this light the phrase reflects a
sort of defeatist resignation to the perils of political plunder.
But Bitcoin redefines victory, not as discriminatory political might, but as a
verifiable, thermodynamic process, at once accessible to all. It casts the
same phrase in a more hopeful light, where history is written not by way of
destructive political wars, but by way of a voluntary, collective, economic game.

As the Bitcoin blockchain marches on, the *cost* of re-writing 
Bitcoin's history increases in proportion to the amount of computing power already spent.
For this reason we talk about Proof-of-Work mining as providing a kind of security.
Some call this kind of security "cryptoeconomic", in reference to the mix of
cryptographic and economic guarantees it provides.

This is not to say social consensus and politics are not involved in Bitcoin or that
Bitcoin is just math and physics. Bitcoin is an evidently political economic institution
with many sources of trust. But the pumping heart of the Bitcoin network, it's
Proof-of-Work backbone, is a thermodynamic process that provides a kind of guarantee about history that we
*do not otherwise know how to produce*. What we get from mining is the most
advanced and robust source of trust for international agreement that we've ever
had. This may prove to be especially important in the coming years amidst what
appears to be increasingly turbulent geopolitical relations. International
sources of agreement are in short supply.

I [like to argue][bitcoin-turns-10] that saying Bitcoin is wasteful is a bit like saying the Sun is
wasteful. Look at how much energy the Sun wastes, and for what?! Of course, the sun
provides a certain kind of guarantee to biological activity on Earth, a robust foundation 
for the development of all the world's ecosystems. I suggest to you that
Bitcoin, and the guarantees it provides, might play the same kind of role in our
evolving digital ecosystem that the Sun plays for life on our planet.

## Big Bad Blockchains

Many people have heard the phrase "blockchains, not Bitcoin", 
meant to express that blockchain technology is a meaningful innovation,
but Bitcoin can be largely ignored. Of course we don't believe Bitcoin can or
should be ignored. But it is also true, contrary to what many so-called "Bitcoin
Maximalists" might avow, that blockchains, independent of Bitcoin, really are a meaningful
innovation. Blockchains innovate in the field of fault-tolerant multi-stakeholder databases
and applications, a field which is itself becoming increasingly important as 
we wrestle with the monopoly power of large corporations and the administrative
overhead of more democratic institutions. We should thus look forward to a proliferation of blockchains, 
perhaps on the order of the number of cities, or even the number of companies in
the world, as a foundation for platforms that better represent and serve their stakeholders.

But does every blockchain need to use Proof-of-Work mining like Bitcoin?
Absolutely not! In fact, there is little justification for 
more than a few Proof of Work blockchains, if not just the one.
I've spent much of the last seven years (along with many other talented people) developing and promoting 
an energy efficient alternative to Proof-of-Work called
[Proof-of-Stake][PoS], where the competitive energy guzzling of miners is replaced by the collaborative pledging of *validators*.
Instead of using energy-hungry Proof-of-Work, the integrity of the history
in a Proof-of-Stake blockchain is guaranteed by having validators pledge their coins in a kind of "bond" which can be destroyed if they
try to re-write history. To a large extent, this is what the [Tendermint][tendermint] and [Cosmos][cosmos] projects have been
about. And we've largely succeeded. Pretty much all major blockchains being built today use Proof-of-Stake validators instead
of Proof-of-Work miners, and thus do away with mining and the ridiculous energy
expenditure therein. There's no real excuse for any new blockchain to use mining.
Even Ethereum, which currently uses Proof-of-Work mining and is second only to Bitcoin, 
has begun its transition to Proof-of-Stake. 

Proof-of-Stake, though, is not a panacea. Powerful as it is, it will never be able to provide the same
guarantees as Proof-of-Work, no matter how close it thinks it can
approximate them for practical purposes. And thus while Proof-of-Stake is
unequivocally the immediate future of blockchains, Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work, and Bitcoin
itself, is not to be dismissed so quickly. But Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake
are also not the end of the story. As alluded to earlier, and outlined in my talk on [Stakeholders and Statemachines][stakeholders-and-statemachines],
Bitcoin is the first stage in a journey towards increasingly representative monetary
institutions, a fractal hierarchy of money that can sustainably [bridge the gap from local self-sufficiency to global
luxuries and back][tweet-crypto-thesis]. That journey leads us from the more
objective, international sources of trust, to the more subjective and local. From
the cryptographically verifiable energy expenditure in a remote data center that
is today's Proof-of-Work, to the communally verifiable delivery of life sustaining care work that is tomorrow's Proof-of-Care. 
Proof-of-Stake may be the next step in that journey - somewhat more subjective, less anonymous, more socially aware than Proof-of-Work. 
But Proof-of-Stake is riddled with it's own issues, many of which parallel the oligopolistic tendencies of modern finance,
of which we have not the time to address here. From Proof-of-Stake validators, we will pass through 
Proof-of-Bandwidth providers, which enable a new breed of [co-operative internet
service providers][althea]. From there, we'll head towards the likes of Proof-of-Produce, Proof-of-Care, and [Proof-of-Plant][proof-of-plant].


## Conclusion

Monetary institutions are not static. They evolve considerably. And they have 
profound effects on the socioeconomic structure of society. Bitcoin's
Proof-of-Work mining provides the most advanced and transparent source of trust for international institutions yet known to our species.
It applies a consistent sort of evolutionary pressure on our institutional forms towards the more verifiable, accessible, and representative - 
that is to say, the more democratic.
It suggests that our international institutions could be grounded, not in
military prowess and colonial conquest, but in our ability to harness energy for
computation. And it suggests a layering, a fractal hierarchy of money, stretching
from the more objective and anonymous work of harnessing electrical energy, to the communal and self-sustaining work of growing food and caring for each other.
It is on the basis of this more humane foundation that we might expect to build a more sustainable society.
