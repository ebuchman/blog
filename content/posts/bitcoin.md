# Orange is the new Green

About a month ago Tesla purchased $1.5B worth of BTC to hold on its balance
sheet. This seems to have made a lot of people angry, or at least
confused. Tesla, a bastion of our clean energy future, is helping us transition
from fossil fuels to electricity.
Bitcoin, a speculative digital asset, is using more energy 
than Switzerland and is largely powered by Chinese coal. 
What gives?

At the time, I tweeted that Bitcoin is actually better for the environment than
Tesla. On the surface, this seems absurd. But our world and socioeconomy is a complex and
dynamic place. Our environmental impact can't be denominated purely in carbon
emissions. Yes, we need cleaner sources of energy. Obviously. But our economy
is also grounded in obscene assumptions about indefinite exponential growth on a
finite planet. Simply adopting a cleaner source of energy doesn't actually
help us there. We still consume and dispose of all kinds of materials at unsustainable levels,
and we prioritize abstract "economic growth" over biodiversity and human well
being. We're going to need deeper structural changes to our economic
system if we actually want to get serious about sustainability. Tesla is not
helping bring about those changes. Bitcoin might be.

## Green Tech

Tesla helps further entrench a number of existing problems in the world.

One is American capitalism itself. Sure, capitalism has a lot of good ideas, and
America's done some good in the world, but the modern incarnation of military-industrial 
American consumerism is not particularly nurturing for a sustainable future. 
Tesla is American capitalism's best foot forward.

Two is the supply chain of modern technology.
The mining industry, for metals like Lithium, Coltan, and more,
is riddled with environmental and human rights abuses.
These are not so much measured in carbon emissions (though there are plenty)
as in pollution and destruction of natural habitats and social relationships.
And a car battery requires many orders of magnitude more Lithium than your Macbook. 
Clean energy has a very dirty supply chain, and little incentive to improve it.

Third is cars themselves. The complete centrality of cars in the
organization of urban life is one of the great tragedies
of our time. 

TODO tweet cars

The sustainability story is intimately bound up with how we organize ourselves
on the surface of the planet. Cars, electric or otherwise, are not
particularly conducive to the more human-scale and bio-diverse patterns that are 
critical to sustainability. To the extent we have cars they should probably be electric. 
But more than anything, we need less cars. Denmark has the right idea. As does
everyone who's ever gotten a street closed to cars, for any duration. Respect.

Now I'm not trying to diss Tesla. I own the stock and have been spotted hailing
the Technoking.
Tesla is the beacon of a research and development process that is itself critical to
sustainability. And if we want to make progress in batteries, which we should, cars are a great
way to go. But the fundamental problems we're facing today don't seem so much technical as they
do political economic. R&D in capitalist companies with dirty supply chains
feeding conspicuous consumerism is probably not really going to help us there.

## Orange Money

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a different kind of a thing altogether.
Yes, Bitcoin is being exploited by American capitalism. Yes, Bitcoin mining
hardware inherits the same dirty tech supply chain. And Yes, Bitcoin uses an
extreme amount of energy. But as far as agents of structural institutional
change at the global level for a more sustainable civilization go? Bitcoin might 
be the best thing we've ever seen.

TODO: ackndowledge more bad stuff

That's a pretty bold statement. And I don't expect to fully convince you here. 
I merely intend to suggest that it's worth seriously thinking about. Bitcoin is
taking its seat at the table of international monetary institutions.
Bitcoin's market cap (~$1T) is almost as much as silver's (~$1.3T), a tenth
of gold's, and a 20th of the US M2 money supply. But Bitcoin isn't a precious metal. 
And it's not something produced by a company, nor a government, 
nor really any distinctly identifiable organization.

Bitcoin is a collective. An open-source, verifiable, transparent, decentralized, 
collective hosting a store of value and a medium of exchange for all to use on
equal terms without discrimination. It sounds exactly like the kind of thing
sustainable human institutions are made of.

Monetary institutions are not static. They evolve considerably. And they have 
profound effects on the economic structure of society. 
Many of the problems of sustainability can be tied back to the institutions of money. 
How is money created? Who is it distributed to? What is it distributed
for? Modern institutions have brought about an enormous decoupling between finance 
and the real socioeconomic activity of the human and natural world. 
Modern finance is notorious for inherent instability and fragility, 
and for fuelling the fire of unsustainable consumerism and speculation.

Bitcoin is the first, and so far most credible, attempt to challenge the current
paradigm, to meaningfully innovate internationally in the basic values of money.
Yes, it manifests largely as a speculative asset right now. But Bitcoin provides a new source of 
*trust* for international monetary institutions that is based in the thermodynamics of computation, 
one of the most fundamental physical processes underlying our civilization. 

## Mining for Trust

Bitcoin are created and issued to those who provably contribute to
the security of the Bitcoin network via Proof-of-Work mining. If
computing power were evenly distributed throughout humanity (which of course
it's not and could never be), Bitcoin would be a sort of Universal Basic Job, 
providing income to anyone who ran the Bitcoin miner. 
The energy used would be stable and proportional to human population. 

Of course in the real world, Bitcoin mining is a highly specialized economic
game played out in transistor sizes and electricity sources. 
Smaller, faster chips; cheaper, denser energy. Mining gravitates to the cheapest sources of
electricity. On the one hand, it's coal plants in China. But on the other, it's
renewables all over the world. While the current ratio might lean towards dirty
energy and the Chinese, it is by no means static. Demand for cleaner mining
operations and more distributed chip production is apparent and growing. 

Bitcoin has become the world's largest supercomputer, 
more powerful than all the other supercomputers combined, though it's computing only a single rather simple
function with seemingly little practical value. 

So what do we even get for all this seemingly wasted electricity? 
We call it *thermodynamic immutability*. 
It means that the integrity of the historical record, 
it's immutability, is not guaranteed by social consensus but by the thermodynamics of the universe.
The principle of social consensus is perhaps best exemplified in the 
adage that history is written by the victors. But Bitcoin provides a historical record 
that is written by miners and can't be re-written without doing as much work as the original miners did.

This is not to say that social consensus isn't involved in Bitcoin or that
Bitcoin is just math. Bitcoin is an evidently political economic institution
with many sources of trust. But the pumping heart of the Bitcoin network is a
thermodynamic process that provides a kind of guarantee about history that we
*do not otherwise know how to produce*. What we get from mining is the most
advanced and robust source of trust for international agreement that we've ever
had. This may prove to be especially important in the coming years amidst what
appears to be increasingly turbulent geopolitical relations. International
sources of agreement are in short supply.

I like to argue that saying Bitcoin is wasteful is like saying the Sun is
wasteful. Look at how much energy the Sun wastes in exchange for the guarantee
it provides that every day humans will wake up to sunlight. My intuitions
suggest Bitcoin can play the kind of role in the emerging digital ecosystem that
the Sun plays for life on our planet.

## Big Bad Blockchains

But does every blockchain need to use Proof of Work like Bitcoin?
Absolutely not. They definitely shouldn't. There's little justification for 
more than a few Proof of Work blockchains, if not just one.

In fact, I've spent much of the last seven years (along with many other talented people) developing and promoting 
an energy efficient alternative to Proof of Work called Proof of Stake.
To a large extent, this is what the Tendermint and Cosmos projects have been
about. And we've largely succeeded. Pretty much all major blockchains being built today use Proof of Stake instead
of Proof of Work, and thus do away with mining and the ridiculous energy
expenditure. There's no real excuse for any new blockchain to use mining.
Even Ethereum, which currently uses Proof of Work and is second only to Bitcoin, 
has begun its transition to Proof of Stake. Danny Ryan, a lead Ethereum
researcher, explains in detail in this podcast.

But as powerful as Proof of Stake is, it will never be able to provide the same
guarantees provided by Proof of Work, no matter how close it thinks it can
approximate them for practical purposes. And thus while Proof of Stake is
unequivocably the future of blockchains, Bitcoin's Proof of Work is not to be
dismissed so quickly.

But the question remains, in a world where Proof of Stake is widely available as
an energy efficient alternative, should mining based Bitcoin continue to exist? 

Sometime in 2016 I wrote a proposal for Bitcoin to adopt Proof of Stake. It was
a bit facetious, but we've been arguing for the better part of a decade now
about all the reasons mining is bad and Proof of Stake is better. Not that the
Bitcoin community would agree. And I don't blame them. When it comes to Bitcoin
itself, I actually don't agree either. Bitcoin's Proof of Work mechanism
actually provides something to the  world that we otherwise don't know how to
achieve. Not even Proof of Stake can provide it, even though we like to pretend
it can approximate pretty closely for all practical purposes. But Bitcoin isn't
concerned with practical purposes. Bitcoin  ...




Bitcoin mining can actually help make renewable energy sources more viable by
serving as a sort of financial battery. Solar energy setups 
require batteries to store surplus energy produced during
the day, and are limitted by the battery in what they can power 
at night or when it's cloudy. Once you've hit the limits of your battery,
instead of disipating the surplus, you can use it to mine Bitcoin, 
and store the value as financial energy
that can be used to purchase electricity later.

Bitcoin is an attempt to ground an economic system in the physical world.
It's by no means perfect, but it speaks to something fundamental, namely, the
distribution of computing power and energy production among humans. 





that more directly represents the values of communities.

Ok, you say, that's great, much respect to Bitcoin's innovation. But now that
the cats out of the bag, surely we don't need to keep wasting exorbitant amounts
of energy. Can't we just stop mining Bitcoin and move on with the rest of the
monetary revolution?


Proving the viability of alternative forms of money in the
world, namely money that represents the values of a community rather than the
liabilities of an unaccountable banking system, is perhaps the most important
legacy of Bitcoin, and is argu

Now, I hold no pretense that Bitcoin will take over the world. I'm not even
sure what that would mean or that it would be a good idea. But Bitcoin has
unleashed, and proven the viability of, arguably the most important idea in political economics
in centuries - that money should be created by and for the people that use it.

Bitcoin are issued when anyone provably contributes energy
to securing the network.

Bitcoin are issued when someone provably does some work. Useless work, to be
sure, but they did it and they proved it, nonetheless.

By all accounts, Bitcoin was supposed to be impossible. It was a joke. It couldn't
possibly work. Silly nerds, obsessing over open-source, verifiability,
transparency, decenentralization, and privacy.

On the one hand, Elon is worshipped as the beacon of capitalism, 
of the power of the entrepreneur to change the world. And perhaps rightly so.
But on the other, what if the capitalist foundation is itself borked? 
What if what we need wasn't cleaner energy cars, but less cars altogether?

I'm not sure it's possible to settle the debate once and for
all, and I'm happy with my personal biases, but people are starting to ask me
how I reconcile Bitcoin's gargantuan energy use with my general
environmentalism, so I thought I'd sketch some thoughts.
