I love writing, and I want to commit to doing more of it.
Once upon a time I had a good cadence going on 
[Blogspot](http://easythereentropy.blogspot.com/), and
when that dropped off, I eventually picked up again on
[Wordpress](https://easythereentropy.wordpress.com/).
But it's been a while. Now I plan to write in Vim and publish on
[Github](https://github.com/ebuchman/blog)
while letting [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) do the hard work of beautifying, 
unless you can convince me of something better.

I'd like to post at least once a week, even if it's short. 
If I don't, please bother me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ebuchman).

What do I plan to write about? More or less what ever I'm wrestling with at the
time. In some sense, trying to crystallize the things I think about when
I go on all those walks.  Writing is a sure fire way to help clarify thought. 

I expect a lot of it will be half baked. I often have intuitions about things
that feel good in my head and sound cool, but I never quite get around to
formally developing them. I'm hoping if I just publish my thoughts to the world on a
semi-frequent basis, folks with greater competence and/or courage than I will
find them interesting and help develop them further.

Here goes!
