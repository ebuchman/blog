[Dan Barabender](https://x.com/dbarabander) wrote a [great little article]
on what he calls "Hourglass Markets," markets bottlenecked by bilateral interemediaries that bridge different trust
layers, and the opportunity for crypto to disrupt them. The article starts with the problem of "stacking and funneling trust" in
the banking system, or what Perry Mehrling would call the [Hierarchy of
Money]. 

Dan explains how the hierarchy of money in a single country (eg. we have
deposits at the banks, who have deposits at the central bank), solves the
problem of payments in that country ("stacking and funneling trust"). But the lack of an international central
bank prevents the solution from being extended to the whole world, causing
international payments to be an archetypal hourglass market requiring
intermediaries to bridge the trust layers of different political jurisdictions.

The cool thing about the hierarchy of money is you technically only have to go
up a level to the extent there is imbalance at a lower level. In other words, if
you can do clearing at one level, you can limit your need to use currency from a
higher level. The largest banks for instance have CHIPS (Clearing House
Interbank Payments System) which lets them clear their interbank debt before
having to resort to moving bank reserves at the Fed. And its not just US banks,
but US branches of foreign banks. So CHIPS is functionally a major international
clearing house for interbank payments. But it's still a tight closed club. And
in 2001 they tightened it up heavily, changing the settlements from once
end-of-day to real-time netting with collateralized net positions. The
collateral requirements seems to have caused like 100 banks to drop out.

A big part of the problem of cross-border payments is that the post-WWII Bretton
Woods settlement was incoherent. Where was everyone supposed to get the USD for
settlement? And how inefficient and constraining it would be without
international clearing. Of course there was an alternative proposal at Bretton
Woods from the British, led by Keynes, for a multilateral clearing union (the
Bancor), which would be the correct way to organize the international financial
order across political regimes. This was actually [originally EF Schumacher's
idea] who was Keynes' protege, but would later diverge from Keynsians heavily in
economics. Alas, we did not get our precious Bancor, and got a USD cursed by
[Triffin's dilemma] instead. 

In the aftermath of the war, without a clearing union, European countries formed
a "spaghetti bowl" of hundreds of bilateral credit agreements. The worst sort of
Hourglass Market. In 1950 they cut through the whole thing in one swoop by
setting up a clearing house, the European Payments Union, which solved the
problem outright and catalyzed the post-war boom.[^end-of-finance] Apparently
successful in its mission, in 1958 the EPU was tragically closed down. What a
tragic end to an incredible international clearing institution. 1958 is also
coincidentally the traditional birth year of the Eurodollar system. 

In the absence of international multilateral clearing like the EPU, cross-border
trade was again an Hourglass Market. What emerged to address it was the
eurodollar system, a dark web of countless bilateral USD credit relations
between international banks. But this was also heavily supported by the launch
of CHIPS in 1970. In the 1980s 75% of the 140 CHIPS members were non-US banks.
And this system seemingly worked for a while until its violent collapse in 2008.
It never recovered. 

Going further back in history, in the 1400 and 1500s, before the rise of central
banks, the trust layers of different political sovereignties were bridged by a
cabal of hundreds of international italian bankers who met every few months at
payment fairs (in Geneva, and later Lyons) to multilaterally clear virtually all european trade credit.[^bdg]
In fact it was the existence of distinct political sovereignties that created an FX
market, even in this period, and enabled the international bankers to
systematically profit from dealing in bills of exchange. Arguably, one of the
major macro forces that killed the Medici for instance was the systematic
imbalance in the payments graph between Flanders and Italy in the late 1400s
that made it impossible to clear balances multilaterally without shipping
gold.[^medici]
The system seemed to recover and peak in the 1500s at the fairs of Lyons (by
this time the Medici were out of banking and into being popes and queens), but
was destroyed by the Spanish, with their Genoese bankers, in the late 1500s
using silver from the new world to mount an attack on the international clearing
system by creating a new source of systematic imbalance: the permanent deficits
of States.[^deficit]

Coming back to modern day and FX, an international clearing house was finally set up in 2002 with
CLS (Continuous Linked Settlement), which completely dominates. So its less clear to me that FX still has the
Hourglass structure Dan describes, at least so long as the "hourglass" designation depends on international relations
being bilateral (it certainly did before CLS, which is what led to creating a
clearing house). Perhaps there is still something to say about the Hourglass nature of markets even if
they're served by multilateral clearing houses, given the highly exclusive nature of those
institutions. CLS only has 70 members. CHIPS 42. It's not a dark web of
bilateral relations per se, but the multilateral net is cast pretty tight. Of
course members in both have complex webs of correspondent relations to extend
indirect access to thousands of others (the nostro/vostro accounts they use for
this date back to the revolution in 14th c banking :) ).

The question I'm asking is how does this all change if we introduce a 
multilateral clearing system accessible to all? Not an exclusive club for the
largest institutions brokering access for everyone else, but a bonafide open
clearing protocol that anyone can participate in. What if clearing, the most
powerful financial capability in history, could be accessed by anyone? 

This is the [Cycles] opportunity. Lets smash the hourglass.
