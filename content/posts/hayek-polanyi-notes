Hayek is widely praised as an originator of a kind of information
economics, inspired especially by his 1945 *The Use of Knowledge in Society*,
where he demonstrates the power of the price mechanism to efficiently distribute 
information and trigger effective reactions, like a kind of distributed
organism. But for Polanyi, the price mechanism works correctly only in reference to 
true commodities, things that are produced for sale on the market. When it is
applied indiscriminately to things which are not produced for sale on the market
- so-called "fictitious commodities" like Land, Labour, and Money - it chronically misrepresents their true nature and results
in all kinds of social dislocations. 


Both authors thus advocate for a kind of
decentralized decision making which is able to effectively represent
information about the world and the humans within it. For Hayek, this is
individuals across the globe interacting with a decentralized price system. But for Polanyi, 
the emphasis is more on cooperatives and local regulatory 



## Road To Serfdom

End of Truth

similarity between Right and Left - opposition to liberalism
impetus towards totalitarianism comes mainly from two great vest interests: organized capital and organized labour 

one decisive factor in the rise of totalitarianism in Europe, that hasn't happened yet in America, is large dispossesed middle class

International Peace.

systematic study of legal institution forms that foster competition has been
neglected - serious shortcomings with law of corporations and of patents

vagueness of "common good". requires comprehensive scale of values.
impossibility of unified view of "what should be done". require more agreement
than exists.

philosophy of indivdiualism - cognitive limits on how much of societies values
one can understand. only partial scales exist.

common action limitted to places where people agree. 

ppl agree they want a central plan, but cant a gree on a plan. tyranny of
minority.


when issue cant be regulated by general rules but power exists or is delegated, then it becomes arbitrary !

price of democracy that conscious control can only apply where true agreement exists, and other fields must be left to chance

democracy not as an end in itself, but a means for safeguarding internal peace and individual freedom

that only under the principles of classical liberalism
is democracy even able to persist, and that the roots of socialism are
explicitly authoritarian, 


arguments:

- Socialism as evil ideology - french roots, german left/right is same fascist
- Liberalism - deliberate institutions where spontaneity works
- Govt - 




## Great Transformatgion

Other points:
- economy vs ecology

- hayek a bastrion of decentralization, but maybe missed need for decentralization
of structure/ institutions themselves? but he did advocate political union
- synthesis in schumacher? ostrom? taleb?
- tradition as limits of uncertainty
- socialism as a wrong headed climax of reasons, resulting in fascism
- austrians as a wrong headed climax of reason, resulting in "anarchy"
- hayek arguing for decentralization due to limits of reason
- polanyi arguing for traditionalism due to limits of reason
- creation of the 19th century market was same kind of quick institutional
  change Hayek warned about - there isnt enough agreement ? !
- long term trade and Jaynes ...



And while this brought about a
Hundred Years of Peace and transformative growth, it was accompanied by rampant
ecological destruction and wealth inequality.







But the political arguments of the *Road to Serfdom* are largely
derived from concerns around 

For Hayek, the problem is one of agreement on

polanyi - econ as representing social relations

theoretical standpoint, where the problem of economics is one of how we evolve
political economic organisms 

---

polanyi: 19th cent based distinctly on economic foundation of self-regulating market which implied individual pursuit of gain as sole sufficient force for organizing all society. no room for political coordination.
hayek argued for global political coordination (!) unlike euro eocnomic
