So it turns out, quite to my delight, there's some pretty good stuff in Modern Monetary Theory (MMT).
For someone who believes that abuse of the money printer is the source of so
much ill in society, this was somewhat surprising, if not terrifying, since MMT appears to be a
licence to crank the printer to 11. And indeed, the current form of
MMT is probably dangerous and incomplete. But even if somewhat misguided, MMT seems to be trying to
refocus economics on an important set of ideas.

MMT was first brought seriously to my attention by George Selgin on Bob Murphy's
podcast. I've been mostly fascinated by Selgin's work on Free Banking,
and the podcast episode included a debate between Selgin and Murphy on if/how free
banking (which includes fractional reserves) fits in an Austrian economic
context. But the episode also included a discussion critiqing MMT, which Selgin
qualified by expressing his admiration for the depth of knowledge among MMT
proponents about the institutional details of modern monetary systems. 
So despite being highly critical of them, Selgin is actually a great recruiter for MMT ;=).

Depth of institutional knowledge has become increasingly impressive to me, so I
took this seriously. I'm also trying to understand the institutional structure
of money, especially in so far as I'm engaged in the rise of cryptocurrency,
which is likely the early stage of a monetary revolution.
Fortuitously, my partner bought me Stephanie Kelton's book The Deficit Myth - the
latest popularization of MMT - for my birthday, which I've just completed. 

The book is a great introduction to the ideas of MMT.
Aside from being a primarily descriptive theory of how monetary institutions
actually work (a kind of external validity that is otherwise apparently rare in economics),
there are three things I think are important about MMT: it's focus on monetary sovereignty, 
its recognition of real resource limits as the fundamental constraint on government spending, 
and its prescription of a decentralized and community-oriented universal basic jobs program.

None of this is particularly new, and the MMT treatment does not seem to be
complete, but I thought I'd summarize my thoughts, the relation between MMT and
cryptocurrency, some of the issues I found in the book, and the direction I
think MMT should go.

## Monetary Sovereignty

At the heart of MMT is Monetary Sovereignty - 
the unrestricted ability to create the currency your debts are denominated in.
Unlike a typical currency user, which has to balance its budget to avoid
bankruptcy, currency issuers with monetary sovereignty can print money to pay
for any debt or desire. The world kind of stumbled into Monetary Sovereignty with the collapse of
Bretton Woods some 50 years ago, though economists, led by Keynes and Lerner, seem to have largely
seen it coming much sooner. Prior to that, currency issuers were disciplined
by a notional promise to redeem currency for metal ("real money"). But a monetary sovereign has
to conjure its own source of discipline.

MMT aims to weild the power of monetary sovereignty to address rampant economic inequality in the US. 
But ironically, that inequality seems to have largely emerged only after (and possibly as a consequence of!) the US
acquiring its monetary sovereignty in the first place, when Nixon closed the
gold window in the early 70s. The book does not seem to acknowledge the strong
and equitable economic growth in the US prior to this time, and is somewhat
sloppy in talking about the monetary sovereignty of the US prior to 1971.

Of course not all countries with a central bank today are monetary
sovereigns. Countries might give up their sovereingty to a super-national entity
(like the European Central Bank). Or they may need to borrow heavily in the
currency of another country (like many developing nations). Or they may decide
to peg their currency, printing only in proportion to some amount of reserves.

Nonetheless, monetary sovereignty seems to be largely
taken for granted, even by MMT, which does not seem to question how monetary sovereignty is acquired or lost.
As Bob Murphy's scathing critique of The Deficit Myth points out, the prescriptions of MMT money-printing
appear to be a sure fireway to betray the trust that monetary sovereignty
implies, and perhaps to lose it altogether (eg. when inflation ultimately forces you to borrow
in someone else's money to afford imports).

Monetary sovereignty, then, seems to reflect some kind of trust - 
trust in the currency issuer to responsibly steward the
currency. The world's monetary sovereigns don't seem to have done a
particularly good job of honoring that trust to date. And as the rise in cryptocurrencies makes clear, there are other ways
to source and enforce that responsibility than the largely unaccountable
mechanisms of modern federal governments. Namely, open-source, transparent,
distributed networks. Cryptocurrencies are in some sense non-nation state
monetary sovereigns in their own right.

MMT is largely a modernization of Aba Lerner's Functional Finance from the 1940s, which draws heavily 
on the chartalist view that money is a creature of the state (as opposed to the
metalist view that money is a commodity). MMT seems to take
this further, arguing (based on Wynne Godley's Sectoral Balances framework) that the source of all wealth is actually government
spending. This is a dangerous notion, misled by an accounting tautology, that mistakes US dollars for wealth
and excludes the actual sources of wealth, namely, raw natural and human
capital. Cryptocurrencies also provide an important counterpoint, as non-state
issued money (or wannabe money, depending on your definitions). But
cryptocurrencies are in some sense also a demonstration of the synthesis of the chartalist and
metalist natures of money; chartalist in so far as the community which upholds
the network is a kind of State that with social consensus can upgrade it, and
metalist in so far as the underlying algorithms are tamperproof and transparent.

So while MMT (or at least the book), provides a largely incomplete story of
monetary sovereignty, the emergence of cryptocurrencies and their promise of
monetary revolution force us to reckon with the true nature of this mysterious
power. What is it, and what does a real theory of it look like?


## Resource Constraints

MMT itself actually provides some hints here in its understanding of the limits
of monetary sovereignty: the real productive capacity of society. The book makes
abundantly clear that MMT is not some kind of free lunch - there are real
limits, and when govenments spend beyond those limits, we'll get inflation.
Of course this isn't really news, but the point MMT is trying to make is that
the constraint on government spending isn't the budget, it's inflation.

- fix inflation with taxes. but this contradicts experience from the 70s

*Monetary Sovereignty* - at the heart of MMT is the idea of monetary sovereignty
- the unrestricted ability to create the currency your debts are denominated in. Monetary
sovereignty is something the world kind of stumbled into with the collapse of
Bretton Woods some 50 years ago. But its something that's also taken on
heightened importance with the recent rise of cryptocurrencies,
each a non-nation-state monetary sovereign in its own right. While MMT focuses
on the sovereignty of currency issuing nation states today, cryptocurrencies lead us
towards the sovereignty of values-based communities tomorrow.

*Resource Constraints* - MMT concludes that monetary sovereigns need not balance
their budgets, since they can print money to cover any deficit. The only
constraint on spending by a monetary sovereign is the actual availability of
real productive resources in the economy. Beyond this limit, spending causes
inflation. Grounding our monetary institutions in the constraints of real productive resources
appears fundamental in many ways to a more sustainable society.

I have recently become fascinated by a strange breed of economics called Modern Monetary
Theory (MMT). 

On the one hand, there is something deeply suspicious about it's
ideas. On the other, it seems to hold some deep promise and truths. 

There's a lot of things I actually really like about MMT: it's descriptive
approach, it's focus on monetary sovereignty, its recognition of real resource
limits as the fundamental constraint on government spending, and its prescription
of a decentralized and community-oriented universal basic jobs program.

But there's also a number things that concern me: the obsessively chartalist
view of money; the cavalier attitude towards government budgetary discipline; 
the lip-service paid to inflationary risks; the confidence that inflation 
can be easily managed through taxation. To name a few.


Issues
- Chartalism - ignores role of of nature/labour and real saving/investing in creating wealth. 
    - also seemingly at odds with thinking about the resource constraint!
    - money must be a reflection of real resource use, not just some state fiat
- promoting imports compromises self sufficiency 
- monetary sovereignty should probably be pushed down
- no indication of how we know when we hit the resource constraint other than
  0%. pay lip service and proceed as if not there.
- much of the inequality it tries to address only emerged after US got monetary
  sovereignty
- increasing taxes during inflation super dangerous - Robert Mundell
- how to organize a proper UBJ ?

I'll take these up in turn.

*Descriptive Approach* - MMT is primarily descriptive. It aims to describe how
the monetary system actually works. In this regard it is incredibly valuable.
Proponents of MMT seem to have deep institutional understanding of the current
monetary system. Apparently, this kind of external validity is otherwise rare in economics.
Go figure. 

*Monetary Sovereignty* - at the heart of MMT is the idea of monetary sovereignty
- the unrestricted ability to create the currency your debts are denominated in. Monetary
sovereignty is something the world kind of stumbled into with the collapse of
Bretton Woods some 50 years ago. But its something that's also taken on

At the heart of MMT is monetary sovereignty, the super power
that distinguishes fundamentally between currency 
users and currency issuers. Those with monetary sovereignty can create the
money thier debts are denominated in. Currency users like you or I do not have
this ability, so we have to balance our budgets. But currency issuers, like the
US and Canadian governments, do have this ability. Thus, concludes MMT, they do
not have to actually balance their budgets, since they can always print money to
cover any deficit. Hence the book title, The Deficit Myth.
