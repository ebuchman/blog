## MoE - Settling Debts, Here and Now

The Medium of Exchange allows us to settle our debts, here and now.
Traditionally, as we've noted, the MoE is taken as the 
primary property of money - not as a way to settle asynchronous debts, 
but as a the means to engage in indirect but synchronous exchange. In this view,
the UoA is largely taken for granted as a mere numeraire, a simple mathematical
convenience for commensurability, and money itself is largely
dismissed as a "neutral veil" over the "real" world of production and trade.

This is of course obtuse and has led to repeated failures in the ability of the 
mainstream economic discipline to understand the repeated monetary and economic crises. 

Let us rather consider that the MoE is itself a map from the SoV to the UoA. 
The production of MoE is an active process in which endowment of the UoA with the SoV
is made manifest. The MoE lets us clear debt that we can't otherwise clear with accounting alone
by making "value" conveniently accessible in units of the UoA. It provides a way
of tiding over imbalances in the payment graph by drawing on the value source to 
settle debts here and now. It resolves an inherent uncertainty about dynamics in
the UoA, providing a way to settle payments now we're not otherwise sure we want to leave
for later. It provides liquidity, a hedge against the uncertainty lying awake in our future
payment obligations.

An imbalance in the payments graph means that there are nodes receiving more
than they're paying, and vice versa. Imbalances persist based on a node's ability
to continuously earn more than they pay.
A node can only continuously benefit from an imbalance if either (1) others are
at a continuous detriment or (2) new money is being created. Perhaps obvious,
but worth restating. If we can't manage
to balance the payments graph, we have to either oppress people or create money - usually both. 
But this framing emphasizes whats at stake when we're talking
about creating money, about provisioning of the MoE. 

For a few thousand years, the primary MoE was metal coins. This is not to say
all commerce was done using coins - much of it was done on credit, from simple
tabs at the pub to complex networks of bills of exchange, there were many early forms in the
hierarchy of money. But at the end of the day, 
metal coins were a dominant means for final settlement of imbalances in the payment graph.

Coins are a rather direct example of how the MoE maps an SoV to the UoA. The
metal as SoV is stored literally in the coin itself. But there are many other
MoE, from commodity forms like coffee beans, cattle, shells, and wampum, to
social forms like bank deposits and mutual credit. Each form maps an SoV
to the UoA in a unique way. Money is not just about trade, but the general
phenomenon of making payments and settling debts. 

The MoE functions as a kind of proof, proof that an amount of the SoV, denominated in the UoA, 
is properly embedded in the medium at hand. Coins are stamped. Bills are signed.
Bitcoin are hashed. Monetary objects are generally speaking verifiable,
and conterfeiting is the art of trying to pass fake proofs. But the necessity
of being a proof implies a cost, which limits the general accessibility of the MoE,
and this cost applies whether using an MoE in its commodity or social form. Both
require a relationship with real resources and institutional maintenance costs.

MoEs thus inherit a scarcity from the SoV and the proof process that limits their accessibility, that puts
them in tension with the UoA, as we've seen. While social theories of money
might proclaim a theoretical abundance to money, they too will acknowledge that
limitations on money are set by the biophysical structure of care, production, and
exchange. As MMT-folks will say, the constraint on money printing isn't the budget,
it's inflation.

If the UoA holds the key to elasticity, 
to magically expand balance sheets and issue credit, the MoE introduces the harsh reality of 
discipline by attempting to ground the growth of UoA denominated mechanics in the availability
of circulating media containing or representing the SoV. 
The UoA in this sense is a Public Good: non-excludable and non-rivalrous.
But the MoE is a Common Pool Resource: it's non-excludable and rivalrous.

One curious phenomenon is that computation spaces made possible by the UoA can
themselves become substrates for new MoEs. This is what gives us the hierarchy of
money. Bank balance sheets, which were
originally elaborations of the UoA on a base MoE of coins in a vault, would
eventually come to be regarded as the primary MoE themselves. For a currency
user in Canada, say, we could consider three levels in the hierarchy of money,
each effectively a distinct MoE. At the
lowest level in the hierarchy is the primary MoE for the user: a bank deposit.
For the bank, its primary MoE is bank reserves with its central bank. And for the
central bank, its primary MoE is the world reserve currency: USD deposits at the
Federal Reserve.
At each level in the hierarchy lies an institution which must
continuously produce proofs of the validity of the MoE, of its legitimacy.

For much of history, the stuff of the MoE was generally speaking freely
accessible, though obtaining it demonstrated some amount of work - whether that
be braiding wampum, collecting shells, or mining gold. We can think of this as
an early kind of what cryptocurrency people call Proof of Work. 
In the case of coins, of course it would be highly non-trivial and unlikely for the average peasant to
mine their own gold, and mining itself was a slave laden afair, 
but generally speaking, a form of "free minting" operated,
where anyone could take bullion to the mint, however they acquired it, and have
it turned into legitimate coins (at the cost of some intrinsic value, for the gain of some
nominal value). This meant provision of the MoE was generally accessible,
though it was conditional on the availability of the metals themselves, which of course was a
sufficiently strong condition that there was almost always a chronic shortage of
coin, especially for smaller payments.

With coin as a dominant MoE, and with an SoV provided largely by private individuals
(rather than states), the production of coinage was a kind of
public-private partnership. Private individuals brought metal to the mint, and
the mint, with blessing of the state, made it into coins - the MoE of the
realm. With the rise of banking, the form of the public-private partnership
would change, but it would remain a partnership nonetheless. Pressure on the MoE
to evolve thus comes from both the public and the private sector - from the
public sector, usually to improve the ability to finance war, and from the
private sector, usually to improve the ability to conduct commerce (which
broadly speaking we might try to understand as improving
[velocity](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/velocity/). 

Such public-private collaboration permeates the entire essence of money.
And as alluded to, the kind of money we use is itself a form of settlement between
the various sectors. But the problem of provisioning the MoE,
and essentially, the element of choice or diversity in what the MoE could be,
highlights a key tension between the MoE and the SoV - that of legitimacy. 
While the structure of accounting (the UoA) is basically declared unilaterally by the State 
(and enforced through tax law), 
and the nature of value (the SoV) can be decided by each individual, the MoE
requires a continuous dance between the too to guarantee legitimacy.

This tension materializes perhaps most clearly as the problem of "good" and
"bad" money, the relation between legal tender laws and private valuations.
On the one hand, if a "bad" (ie. debased) money is made legal tender, it will drive out the "good" money -
this is Gresham's Law. On the other hand, if given the choice between which
money to use, people and societies will generally gravitate towards the "good"
money, the money that better holds its value - this is Thier's Law. 
While Gresham's law historically pushed higher
valued metallic coins out of circulation, Thier's law leads to things like
clandestine adoption of USD or Bitcoin.

But the tension is more complex than this, especially given that throughout
history there is more likely to be a multiplicity of MoEs operating in
complement to one another. This is seen most explicitly in say Europe's medieval 
bimetallic standards, with, roughly speaking, silver coins accomodating small peasant transactions
and gold coins accomodating large merchant transactions, and the need for states to maintain legitimacy through both. There is also a widespread tradition of communities and subsidiary states making their own MoEs
to accomodate a particular domain or scale of trade (eg. local copper coins in
China's silver regime, cities issuing scrip money during the Great Depression).
In either case, MoEs embed not just the literal value of the metals they
contain, but the social value of being able to clear in a particular payments
graph. 

This tension between the MoE and the SoV is where cryptocurrencies live and
breath. They have yet to crack the nut of the UoA just yet, and are mostly
piggybacking on the USD for now, but the innovation in proof technology - for
generating a MoE containing proof of a kind of value storage - is astounding.
But what do we even mean by value storage? We turn to that next.

## SoV - Settling Debts, Elsewhere or Later 

The Store of Value allows us to settle our debts, elsewhere or later.
That is, as a value store, it can be transported across space to 
settle payments in another UoA, and it can be transported across time to 
settle payments in the future. It is our hedge against space and time.

If the MoE maps the SoV into the UoA so we can clear a debt here and now, the
SoV keeps that debt clearing capacity safe for later. While the MoE hedges the
uncertainty in our payment obligations within a given UoA, the SoV hedges the
uncertainty of the UoA itself. The MoE hedges uncertainty *in* the
payment graph, but the SoV hedges the uncertainty *of* the payment graph.

What does it mean to store value? Theories of value are notoriously fickle, and
we will do well to proceed with caution. We have here been considering money as
a kind of computational phenomenon - the payments graph. In this graph, the MoE
and SoV play distinct roles in resolving uncertainties about future obligations
in the graph. We might consider a theory of value, then, to proceed from a
consideration of its relationship with obligations - which is to say,
commitments to fulfill particular outcomes in a particular time - in other
words, to control the future.

The most straightforward way to control the future is by violence. Simply be
stronger and more brutal than anything or anyone you might encounter and need to subdue.
This strategy has been a mainstay of human history, and it has given
overwhelming emphasis to stores of value that are effective in commanding political violence,
which is where precious metals in particular have excelled. 
As Colin Drumm has put it, metal in the coin is the King issuing an option on
rebellion, for the baron can melt his coins for metal and hire foreign
mercenaries. But the ultimate success
of the strategy of violence to control the future, while always a threat, is not
guaranteed. If not defeated on the ground of political awakening, it is ultimately defeated by
Nature herself, against whose strength and brutality, especially on a global
scale, and even more so while being attacked, is anything we mesely humans can control or predict. 

Nature, then, introduces a fundamental uncertainty that threatens the stability
of any payments graph. To store value is to hedge that
uncertainty, which can only be meaningfully done through the construction of
some elaborated relationship with Nature herself - which tunes to her in some
way, and represents her capacities. The SoV becomes a reflection
of the common denominator in man's relationship to nature. For a very long time,
that was captured by precious metals - by institutions of mining, metallurgy,
measurement, and coinage. More recently, we are playing with a
strange theological substance[^kantorowicz] made possible by double entry bookeeping and the
angelic fiction of the corporation - we have lifted the SoV function from the
institutions of precious metal to the instsitutions of the corporate balance
sheet. This represents a tectonic shift in the relationship between man and
nature, and the way that relationship was written into the grooves of society at
large.

That the value system chosen for the SoV is a kind of "common denominator", 
we can naturally ask, common at what scale? In principle, there is a big difference
between what I have "in common" with my neighbour compared to what I might have
in comon with someone on the other side of the planet. True, the ravages of
globalization have ameliorated that somewhat, but the physicality of our existances and
the problems of energy and transport constrain us such that we do have something
more in common with our neighbour than our pen pal, and that is, for lack of a
better word, our local Nature. We might consider, then, that our monetary system
could be storing value at difference scales, differently according to the
commonolaties we face at each scale and the local uncertainties we need to
hedge. 

This observation has not been lost on the history of monetary experiments, and
more than one European nation has found itself trying to issue currency backed
by Land[^land-notes] - that is, where land, rather than precious metal, serves as the SoV. 
These cases tend to end in disaster, not least because of the inability to meaningfully
redeem a banknote (MoE) for the land (SoV) it supposedly represented. Redemption
is the means of "challenging" the proof of the MoE, and the presence of
regular and consistentent redemption activity often serves as a guarantor
of financial soundness. 

More generally, we might say that historical land owners (say feudal lords)
could also hedge the uncertainty of the payments graph by storing value in their
estate. This does not mean they used their estate as an SoV in a monetary system
per se, though they could and did use components of their estate to
settle various debts, for instance by selling off a piece of their land, or even
by marrying off their daughter. But the self-sufficiency of an estate is itself
a hedge against the uncertainties of the existence of a payments system, and in
this sense, we might take the ultimate store of value to be the self-sufficient
community.

Mutual credit communities are an attempt to create an MoE, denominated in a common unit of account,
where the value store is the productive capacity of the community itself. The loans that create mutual credit
currency are effectively collateralized by the future productive capacity of the
firm taking out the loan - ie. if $100 of the token is created and lent to a
firm, the firm commits to accept say $500 of the token in exchange for the goods
or services it produces. The reserve tokens created by the clearing houses of
banks are effectively mutual credit for banks - but such systems can also be
built directly for businesses.

While mutual credit is a highly promising means of mapping the productive
capacity of firms to a means of exchange, it does not directly address the
problem of how sustainable value is stored in the UoA.[^grassroots]
What are we to say then about the relation between such an ideal store of value, in
self-sustaining natural and social capital, and the necessities of a SoV for a monetary system?
Obviously there is the problem of constructing the MoE in a way that it
meaningfully represents the value stored, and is redeemable for it. And a sound
system must have regular and healthy run ins with redemption.[^free-banking] Exactly how to go
about structuring such systems remains an open question.

Answering these question will require dramatically improved ways of theorizing
about and making money. Two developments stand out in this regard. The first are the
cryptocurrency communities, where experimentation abounds as to how to issue
tokens redeemable for collectively generated functionality. Cryptocurrencies
contain an impressive underbely of meaningful innovation in monetary design, but
they are also awash in pathological rent-seeking - of course, early banking was no different. 
The second is the MMT community, which is trying to develop a more serious economics
of how monetary media should be provisioned against the current realtiy of the
production system. In its worst, MMT is naive communism in new garb, but at its
best, it's a genuine attempt to integrate the various heterodox schools into a
more sustainable political economy. In any case, MMT and cryptocurrencies appear
as almost archetypal hostile siblings, wrestling over the future of money (see
my [post][mmt] on the matter).

Both cryptocurrencies and MMT raise questions about a tension between the SoV
and the UoA, a tension we will call solvency, which is about the amount of the
SoV maintained in the UoA. How much is the unit of account worth? We most
commonly talk about this problem in terms of "inflation" and "deflation", which
are themselves complex multifacted processes.

As we noted, cryptocurrencies primarily play in the tension
between the MoE and the SoV, - no one takes them seriously as a UoA, yet.[^rai]
But they are an attempt to do through cooperative and voluntary means what so
many monetary systems before them have done by coercive and violent means:
establish a UoA and imbue it with a value store.[^filling-hole] New units of 
a cryptocurrency tend to be created and issued to those contributing value to its 
socio-technical community. Naturally, cryptocurrency
communities are obsessed with the problem of value store in their tokens.
While this tends to be crudely measured in terms of market price in USD, the
real value stored in a cryptocurrency is the socio-technical community and
infrastructure that maintains and evolves it. 

MMT, for its part, is all about readdressing the nature of solvency in the
monetary system. For them, the solvency of a monetary sovereign is not defined
by its budget, but by its real resources. Like cryptocurrencies, MMT advocates
for the issuance of new monetary units to those contributing a kind of basic
value to society, like care work. This is MMT's basic jobs program. It seeks to
tie the rate of money creation to the real resource capacity of society, and to
engage in more nuanced supply-side policy to manage this effectively. While
a promising and welcome development, MMT has an overwhelming tendency to be Seeing like a
State. It focuses too much on the tax loop, and not enough on the other loops
that abound in the payments graph.

Increasingly over the last few hundred years, value has come to be stored in
financial assets. One of the most important of these was human beings
themselves, as slaves. Slaves ... War. Treasury bonds.

Monetary system should be in service of self sufficiency and effectively
represent it. But always need to be aware of contingency of war - the ultimate
self sufficiency. UoA as basic unit of defence.

---

Earlier we noted the possibility of monetary settlement in-kind, of settling a
debt denominated in the UoA by producing something else, something not the MoE,
with an equivalent value in the UoA. We mentioned that here value was stored
somewhere outside the MoE, in a form which never even needed to manifest in the
MoE, and which therefore availed itself of the "common" SoV. This possibility
highlights the reltionship between the UoA and the SoV, and the tension that
lies between them.

Between the UoA (denominating debts) and the SoV (clearing debts, later) lies
the tension of inflation and deflation, which reflects how the UoA "dissipates"
or "accumulates" from the value store over time, as conditions require.  The UoA needs
to inflate to ease the pain of clearing failures (ie.  insufficient provision of
MoE to clear UoA denominated debt). And it needs to deflate to reflect genuine
productivity gains and to support stability of trade.  Around this tension
revolves the dance of entrepreneurs and workers seeking to allocate the risks
and rewards of monetary organization so that they can afford the output of their
collective production.

I think different parts of the crypto landscape might be going after different
tensions.

Between UoA & MoE is a tension between elasticity and discipline. We'll call
this liquidity.

DeFi is exploring this - ow to embed value flow in a token. This is where crypto
was born. 
Tokens fighting to be legitimated as means of exchange by securing
some way to store value.

ReFi is exploring this. How to actually account for what we value in the world.
