*This is part 1 of a 3 part series on the factors of production.
See the [introduction to the series] for more.*

Here we review the standard treatment of the factors of production and some
critiques. We then present our conception.

## The Factors of Production

TODO

review factors of production
- factors an invention of market society - fictitious commodities
- primary: land, labour, capital
- secondary: materials, energy
- income: rent, wages, interest
- production function - 
    - focus on labour and capital
    - carried away with marginal utility analysis
- capital - fixed, working
- capital and money insufficiently represented
    - cambridge controversy -> Post-Keynesians
    - Hyman Minsky, MMT - money not in the math, its in the balance sheets
    - austrian capital theory ignored
- energy not considered well
    - georgescu-roegen
    - ecological economics

## Reconsidered

If we are to reconsider the factors of production, 
in pursuit of a more sound political economy,
we must attend to the particular nature of
each factor, and to how the factors relate to one another.
We cannot abstract away their character by equating them mathematically 
to that of commodities, blindly interchangable with one another on "the market".

The first observation is that all factors, indeed, all economic activities,
have a material basis and an origin in the endowment of the Earth - 
its natural resources, its reliable sunlight, its laws of biology and physics.
This endowment, which we refer to as Land, is the fundamental factor,
from which all other factors emerge. We come from the Land, and we return to the
Land. Land is the living bounty of the natural world. This is so plainly true and yet so plainly forgotten in standard economic affairs. 

That there should be factors other than Land is then a matter of perspective.
If everything comes out of the Land, why distingish any new factors, and indeed,
how? 

We propose that distinct factors of production be distinguished by their
exposing a major new dimension for the organization of production,
through which that factor transforms the landscape of possible activity on Land.
It is in this new dimension that the dynamics of the factor play out - Labour
plays out in space, Capital in time, Energy in, well, energy, and Money in
what we'll call for now "maturity transformation". Each factor proceeds
progressively out of those that come before it, augments them, and feeds back on them. 
In turn, each such factor calls for a distinct social theory to accomodate the 
unique manner in which it expands the landscape of production and relates to the
other factors. 

We will not pretend here to have a complete, unique, or fully consistent model.
Our goal is to sketch a broad theory of the factors of production, 
and their dynamic interaction with one another and with society as a whole.

The first factor to emerge from Land is Labour. Labour is human life itself.
But the raw labour of the human animal, unaided by Capital, is not all that different from that 
of the myriad other animals. At its core, then, labour is perhaps something common to
the entire Animal kingdown. And yet human Labout is distinct from the rest of the natural world in the
command it affords us over our environment. Human labour
transforms space in its favour in a more acute manner than does any other living thing.
It augments the Land. But human labour is also human life - the very essence of our being. 

A fundamnetal component of human labour is its capacity to be "roundabout" -
to be performed in service not of an immediate goal, but a future one. 
Roundabout human labour implies Capital, the chief augmentation of Labour - tools and
intermediate goods produced to serve future production. 
If the dynamic of Labour plays out in space, the dynamic of Capital plays out in time.

Initially, Capital is primarily animated by direct human Labour. It has, over the
centuries, also made use of other forms of energy - both natural forces like the
wind and the flowing river (rightly considered part of Land), but also what
we'll call capital forces, like fire pits and candle light. In its simplest form, these capital
forces operate at a scale on par with the humans, and can largely be conceived
of as part of capital. But as they are developed, and as their scale grows largely
beyond that of individual humans, they take on the independent character of a
factor of production - Energy. 

All processes require energy. In the simplest
cases it comes from human Labour, in more advanced cases from Capital stores.
But 




Of course if we were to only study Land we would be doing ecology, not
economics. Economics emerges from the curious behaviour of Humans,
which are so markedly 

Are there other dimensions, besides space and time, out of which we might expect
to distinguish factors of production?

Of course, in so far as we are at least concerned with the character of
Humans and their impact on the natural world, we recognize a factor which
emerges out of Land, that of human Labour. 

Human Labour is the generalization of
the capacity for animals for 

Accounting for our upright gait, opposable thumbs,
and use of language

It should also be noted, that while they do not
take part in exchange, some animals do produce an utilize capital - the nests of
birds, the dams of beavers, etc.


has a view
of itself as subject and Land as objective


sketch new theory 
- consider relationships between the factors themselves
- land is the lowest-order factor, others emerge from land in higher orders: labour, capital, energy, money
- start from land. individuate. animals. tools, etc.
- capital is to labour what money is to energy (!?)
- Each factor transforms the dimensionality of the field of production
- Each factor has a cost to employ: rent, wages, natural interest, entropy, money interest
- Each factor feedback on those lower than it 
- Each factor is deserving of a social theory and institutions that uphold it
- Fictitous commodities and the non-economic
