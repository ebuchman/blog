I recently read F.A. Hayek's *Road to Serfdom* and Karl Polanyi's *The Great
Transformation* back to back. Both published in 1944, these great works of
poltiical economics were attempts by their authors to grapple with the collapse of western civilization into
the fascist totalitarianism of the Second World War. 
For Hayek, the great defender of classical liberalism, totalitarian tragedy follows inevitably 
from the authoritarianism of State Socialism.
For Polanyi, champion of the embedded nature of economy in society, 
it followed inevitably from the dehumanizing forces of Market Capitalism.
On the surface, the two views seem diametrically opposed. But the two have much more 
in common than meets the eye. At a deeper level, they
share a kind of information theoretic concern about the ability of the
economy to represent the natural and social world it is embedded in.
Perhaps it is actually the failure of this representation mechanism that causes us to lapse into the totalitarian.

For Hayek, that information theoretic concern is the limited capacity of
centralized decision making in complex economies. 
In this view, markets are an evolutionary medium in which the forces 
of competition enable new information about reality to be organically adapted to and asssimilated.
Hayek thus argues for decentralized decision-making and the fostering of competition among individuals 
in the context of slowly evolving institutions with strong Rule of Law.
This means generally applicable rules that are easy to understand and reason
about.

For Polanyi, the information theoretic concern is the limited capacity 
of market-based systems to represent more substantive patterns of natural and
social organization. He emphasizes that markets are one pattern among many in a
toolkit necessary for representing the natural and social worlds. The book is
largely a history of the Great Transformation that took place over the course of the 
industrial revolution, where land, labour, and money were fictitiously
commodified, and all of society became violently subject to the cold, artificial 
logic of a global, self-regulating, Market System.

Curiously, despite their allegedly opposing political views, 
there are a number of biographical threads that tie Hayek and Polanyi together. 
Both were born in late 19th century Vienna (Hayek in 1899, Polanyi in 1886). 
Both served for the Austro-Hungarian Empire in WWI. 
Both received doctorates in Law (Hayek from Vienna, Polanyi from Budapest). Both were
associated with Jewish intellectuals (Polanyi actually was Jewish, Hayek merely
suspected of being so). Both came from families of high intellectual
achievement: Polanyi's brother Michael was a noted polymath, 
and would later correspond extensively with Hayek; 
Hayek was second-cousins with Wittgenstein, whom he greatly admired,
and his grandfather was a close friend of 
Bohm-Bawerk (co-founder of Austrian Economics).
Both Hayek and Polanyi participated in the [Socialist Calculation
debate][socialist-accounting-tweet] of the 1920s,
and both fled to London in the early 1930s. Polanyi's daughter, herself an economist,
even studied under Hayek at the LSE!

Here, we explore the synergies between these authors through the perspectives
expressed on socialism, markets, and decision-making, aiming to highlight the complementary information theoretic
concerns at play. In a way, both Hayek and Polanyi seem
to transcend a crude Left vs. Right dichotomy through a more "localist"
predilection. It is this synergy between them I am hoping to elucidate.

## Socialism 
Socialism means a lot of things to a lot of people, and meant different things
to both authors. Confusion in the meaning of "socialism" appears to
be at the heart of a great deal of strife between people. So it's worth trying
to clear things up.

The socialism Hayek attacks is what we might call State Socialism.
This is is the explicitly authoritarian thread of socialism that runs from
the French tradition of Saint Simon, through the German tradition of Marx, 
advocating effectively for technocratic dictatorships.
Hayek contends that this line of thinking is an "abuse of reason",
where the methods of the natural sciences are inappropriately applied to social problems,
resulting in arrogant technocrats and dangerous scientism. 
The Road To Serfdom is itself part of a larger project that Hayek called the
"Abuse of Reason" project, where he traced out the nature of this problem more
broadly. Society and economy
are too complex to be so comprehensivley understood and directed by 
such limited rationality; there are fundamental limits to centralized
decision making. There is much evidence to support this, and
he traces out how such arrogant technocracy has led to totalitarianism on both
the Left and the Right - both the tragedies of Marxism in the Soviet Union 
and Nazism in Germany share this common intellectual tradition.
A number of non-totalitarian but still fatal examples of this
kind of arrogant technocratic management of society are especially well captured in the book 
[Seeing like a State][seeing-like-a-state]. 

Polanyi, for his part, is no advocate of State Socialism. He could even
be said to agree with the general thrust of Hayek's argument, which is 
itself an extension of that of Hayek's mentor, Mises, who kicked off the
"socialist calculation" debate in the 1920s. Mises argued that State Socialism, 
in the absense of market prices, could not perform the calculations necessary to
organize complex production. At the time, Polanyi published "socialist
accounting", where he agreed with Mises, but argued that market capitalism
could not perform the calculations either, because it could not sufficiently account 
for environmental and social costs. Polanyi thus proposed a model consisting of
multi-scale cooperatives to organize production. Mises responded that such
proposals are better understood as "syndicalism". For Mises,
socialism meant only Marxist State Socialism.

Polanyi's socialism follows in the tradition of Robert Owen, the founder of the cooperative movement. 
In this view, the role of the state is not to organize or direct society, but rather to help avert harm.
Hayek expresses a not too disimilar sentiment, when he advocates a role for
the state in regulating production for protective purposes, for instance to restrict the use of poisons, 
or limit working hours.
But while Hayek might leave production to be organized by an abstract entrepreneur, 
Polanyi and Owen emphasize the importance of small, local cooperative organizations
as the institutional form to organize around.

But socialism is something still more general for Polanyi. It is a recognition of the [embeddedness] of economy in society,
an understanding that economic activity is always embedded within a larger social body. 
It is a rejection of the notion of economics as a somehow distinct, and more
scientific, displine from politics or sociology. This, in principle, would seem
to resonate with Hayek's rejection of economic scientism.
But Polanyi further emphasizes the distinction between formalist and subtsantivist economic models - the formalist
being concerned with rational decision making under conditions of scarcity, the
substantivist with a more organic study of how humans sustain themselves in their social and natural environments.
And in this sense, despite rejecting the abuse of reason in mainstream,
formalist economic models, Hayek is certainly
more of a formalist. But it is in the substantivist model where other pro-social forces and patterns of organization,
beyond simply market competition, play a critical role in the organization of
society.

The Great Transformation is the tale of how the economy became disembeded from
society; how the new Market Society was constructed deliberately as a legal
fiction by the State; and how the social body reacted in response. Polanyi
referred to this alternation as the "double movement";
where (1) deliberate action to implement formalist economic ideas in law would cause
economy to be further disembedded from society, resulting in (2)
spontaneous counter-movements by the social body to protect itself by
attempting to reembed economics in society. Socialism in this sense is a kind
of spontaneous response of the substantive society to the dislocating effects of
forced formalist economic ideals. Polanyi sees much of the 19th century as a 
a history of society trying to protect itself from the violent dislocations
wrought by the industrial revolution - its satanic mills, slums, and
proliferation of the poor. Thus Polanyi quipped:
"laissez-faire was planned; planning, was not".

Let's take a closer look at what the two authors had to say about markets
themselves.

## Markets

Given the fundamental limits set out on the centralized direction of social
processes, Hayek seeks to make as much use as possible of the spontaneous forces of society, 
and as little use as possible of coercion. This is the essence of Hayek's
liberalism. It builds on the fundamental revolution of the Englighment
- the perogative for each individual to think for themselves - by using the
forces of competition to make the best possible use of the 
heterogenous information distributed across individuals in society - their
preferences, understandings, and inventions. 

Polanyi, in contrast, cautions that not all spontaneous change is good. 
In his view, the philosophy of liberalism largely disregards political science
and statecraft. Polanyi argues that fast, undirected changed needs to be slowed,
where possible, to safeguard community welfare. Hence the importance of the rate of change of
institutions within society, not just the direction! But these views are not
incompatible. The spontaneity Hayek seeks to leverage emerges within a particular
institutional system. The spontaneity Polanyi seeks to restrain is that used to
evolve the institutional system. Notably, Hayek makes a similar argument about the 
need for institutional change to occur slowly. 
Thus both authors thus express a kind of respect for tradition the emphasizes the not
necessarily rationally-accessible information contained in traditional
institutions, and the importance of a slower rate of change to enable
the social body to adapt and respond appropriately.

It's important to note that Hayek is no naive adherent to a static laissez-faire idealism.
He critiques the laissez-fair ideologuies repeatedly. 
On the contrary, he argues definitively in favour of a critical role for government in
the deliberate creation of institutions which nurture the positive and
regulate the negative externalities of market forces. Competition depends on sound institutions of money, 
markets, and information channels, not all of which can be adequately provided by the private
sector itself. Hence there is a critical role for legal system in establishing a
fair and robust environment in which competitive forces can be effectively put
to work. In this context, Hayek does not oppose an extensive system of social services, 
so long as they dont make competition ineffective over wide fields. 
Protective regulations on the means of production
(eg. to restrict the use of poisons, or limit working hours, etc.) are
supported, so long as they are applied equally and not used as an indirect way to control prices. 

In a sense, Hayek conceives of the market as a kind of distributed organism, 
a vast information network that can adapt and respond effectively to changes in
the environment. This conception is made even more clear in his "The Use of Knowledge in Society", published in 1945,
considered to be the founding work of a more information theoretic economics.
But while Hayek emphasizes the critical importance of local
decision-making within the market system, he has little to say about the locality of the markets themselves.
Thus while he provides a conception of the market as an organism,
we must turn to Polanyi for a better understanding of that organism's boundaries. 
In a very real sense, life, and sustainable systems in general, are defined by their
relationship to their boundaries.

Polanyi highlights that historically, markets have always been a socially
embedded phenomenon. And he is careful to highlight two distinct kinds of
historical market: the well regulated local markets contained largely within
towns, and the long distance markets of traveling traders on the boundaries
between different civilizations. The former were well regulated affairs,
enabling competitive forces to play out in a localized and restrained manner.
But the latter were more in the spirit of the hunt.


Markets
- Hayek's liberalism and spontaneity
- Hayek not naive laissez faire
- Hayek market as organism, but need Polanyi for boundaries
- Polanyi historical markets - local and long distance
- Polanyi creation of national markets, and synthesis into intl market
- Polanyi fictitious commodities
- Polanyi other modes of organization

## Decision Making

- Hayek tragedy of socialist thought. humility.
- limits to democracy
- rule of law
- respect tradition
- Polanyi ...

For Hayek, the great tragedy of much socialist thought is that it innevitably devours itself.
Predicated on a presumption that reason is supreme, that it can be used to
rationally organize society, that the technocrats can fully understand and direct the social body, 
it misconceives the process by which reason itself develops and evolves: differences in the knowledge and views of individuals.
Hayek's individualism is an "attitude of humility before this social process", a "tolerance to other opinions".
It is the "exact opposite of that intellectual hubris which is at the root of the demand 
for comprehensive direction of the social process". The fatal consequences of
the technocratic arrogance that Hayek warns about are on display all around us,
and are especially well captured in the book [Seeing
like a State][seeing-like-a-state]

That said, Hayek warns about the limits faced by democracies in their efforts to
plan and regulate society. Pursuit of the common good or the general wellfare is
only possible in areas where there is legitimate agreement on the scale of values
and what should be done. But in many cases, such planning would require more
agreement than actually exists in society! This puts it at grave risk of falling prey to a tyranny of the
minority, of the largest group able to agree. 

Thus, Hayek stresses the importance of the Rule of Law - fixed, long-term, general purpose
rules that do not favour particular groups or people but can be used by anyone
to predict the behaviour of others and thus to collaborate in unplanned ways.
This is in contrast to arbitrary discretionary power often exercised by governments
to favor one group or another, which inevitably interferes with and complicates the plans of everyone else.
If an issue cannot be regulated by general rules, and yet power to regulate it
exists, then that power must be arbitrary.
He argues that the application of the law without exception may be even more important
than the actual particulars of what the law says (the Medium is the Message!), emphasizing the utility
of the Rule of Law as an instrument for reducing uncertainty about the world and
thus enabling individuals to more effectively plan for, and look after, themselves. 



## Conclusion




On these grounds, Hayek thus argues for the importance of market forces and
competition in surfacing the necessary information to make decisions and
organize production in more decentralizated fashion. He advocates a role for
the state in establishing institutions that support competitive processes.

The two political economists also appear to be in agreement on a number of theoretical points, though
they frame them and arrive at them from different angles. Both seem to argue for:
local markets and decision-making; social institutions that 
better represent the structure of society; the gradual evolution of institutions;
and the critical role of the legal system in economics. 

## The Road to Serfdom

Three threads:

- liberalism as enabler of democracy
- history of socialist thought and its inherent inconsistency. scientism
  (natural science applied to society)
    - liberal ideas spread from England for 200 years till 1860. German ideas
      spread back
- analysis of the use of spontaneity and planning

- spontaneity and rule of law

The Road to Serfdom is undisputably the more popular book, and has had a more significant impact on
policy, especially in 1980s Britain and America. At a high level, the book is a
defense of the principles of classical liberalism and an attack on those of
State Socialism. Hayek argues that democracy is only possible under liberalism, that 

## The Great Transformation

While the Road to Serfdom is something of a popular polemic, the Great
Transformation is a different book entirely. It is much denser, broader in
scope, and more deeply historical. The book opens with an analysis of the
balance of power between the great nations of the 19th century that sustained
a unique century of peace, and how that balance broke down into the world wars.
But for Polanyi, the first World War was simple conflict of powers due to
collapse of balance of power - but WWII was upheavel ...

Polanyi called Land, Labour, and Money the "fictitious commodities", for they
are not by their nature produced for sale on the market. Land, for
instance, constitutes the entire natural world of ecosystems and geological
forces, our great inheritance from the eons of physical and biological evolution
in the Cosmos. It is not the result of any kind of human production process. It is surely not of the same type as a bag of corn!
And Labour is the very capacity for human beings to actively engage in the world. It is our animating
force. It is not of the same type as a sheet of iron! 
To adequetely represent them, we must acknowledge additional patterns of economic organization beyond the 
price-mechanism of the market. Such patterns have been used for millenia, and
can still be found dominant in certain indiginous societies - patterns like 
reciprocity, redistribution, and self-sufficiency.

Polanyi argues that the construction of this great fiction - the international
commodification of Land, Labour, and Money - was a concerted institutional design
effort throughout the early 19th century that produced a Great
Transformation: the birth of Market Society. That transformation destroyed
existing patterns of local organization and the information contained therein 
by suddenly exposing and subjugating the entire apparatus of society to
the international market. In effect, economics was torn from the bossom of
society and made its master.


- Institutionalization of post adam smith economic ideas. 
- gold standard as means of extending domestic to intl market. self regulation
- evolution of isolated into self regulating markets. steps taking isolated markets into a market economy, taking regualted markets into self-regulating market are crucial - not an inherent tendency of markets but effect of artificial intervention
- neither long-distance nor local markets are essentially competitive - little
  pressure to create national markets
- classic argument goes from local trade up to intl markets. should be reversed.
  trade starts intl on boundary - origin of trade in obtaining goods from a
  distance, like in a hunt
    - external trade more in the nature of adventure,m exploration, hunting,
      piracy, and war than of barter - more principle of reciprocity than of
      barter . does not imply markets!
- external markets entirely different from local or internal markets  -
  institutions of different function and origin
    - local and external markets both complementary, less competitive.. but
      internal trade is competitive
- towns sprang from markets, both to protect them, but also to prevent them from
  spreading into the country. dual meaning of "towns contain markets". markets
  were tightly regulated.
- trade limited to local trade in towns or as long distance. strictly separated,
  neither allowed to infiltrate countryside indiscriminately 
- deliberate state action in 15th/16th century"foisted the mercantile system on
  the fiercely protectionist towns and principalities". destroyed particularism
  of local and intermuncipial trading by breaking down barriers separating these
  two types of noncompetitive commerce and clearing the way for national market
  which ignored distinction between town and countryside, between various towns
  and provinces
    - competition leads to monopoly!
 
- under feudalism/guilds, land and labour part of social organization itself
  (money not a major element of industry ). mercantilism unified this throughout
  country. mercantilism never tried to make labour/land part of commerce
- feudalist privilege (guilds) abolished end of 1700s. no free market of labour
  discussed until end of 1700s
- "A self-regulating market demands nothing less than the institutional
  separaation of society into an economic and a political sphere" - "normally,
  the economic order is merely a function of the social order"
- with coming of elaborate/specific machinery and plants the relationship
  between merchant and production changed.  now involves long term investment
  and risks.

consequences

reintegration of society into human world became aim of social thought. Marx a
failed attempt to do that (too close adherence to Ricardo and liberal econ)

"One man alone perceived the meaning of the ordeal - no thinker ever advanced
father into the realm of industrial society than did [[Robert Owen]]. Aware of
distinction between society and state. no prejudice against latter. looked to
state merely for that which it could perform: helpful intervention designed to
avert harm from the community, emphatically not the organizing of society"

- self regulating market is utupia that will destroy everything! - society will
  defend itself. Double Movement. Poor laws.
- industrial revolytion -> dislocation. satanic mills, slums
    - 19th cent a history of society trying to protect itself from this
- double movement. economic liberalism aims to establish self regulating market.
  social protection aims to conserve man, nature, and productive organization
- two vital functions of society - political and economic - used/absued as
  weaponsin struggle for sectional interest. 20th century fascism came out of
  this deadlock.


  to Physiocrats, laissez faire was just free export of grain for better farmer
  incomes, really just freedom from regulation in production. not full blown
  Market Society. freedom from regulation in production, not exchange!


- liberal philosophy accepts all spontaneous change. but this is failure. disregards political science and statecraft. fast undirected change needs to be slowed where possible to safeguard community welfare
    - rate of change is important. not just direction!
    - role of gov to slow rate of change. time for adjustment (mcluhan?)
        - ps: mcluhan loved polanyi

- economy submerged in society. econ systems runs on non econ motives. social
  anthro, max weber, cant dismiss primitibve econ. changelessness of man as social being
    - absence of motive of gain in primitive society
    - importance of "redistribution" in past. origin of moeny ... reciprocity.
      self sufficiency( house holding, origin of econ!) !
- all known economic systems up to end of feudalism organized on some combination
of reciprocity, redistribution, and householding. no motive of gain.
insititunioal patterns prevailed over markets until end of middle ages. markets
more important from 16th cent on but didnt control society till 19th
- tradition as limits of uncertainty


1830s and 1840s saw major repeals of restrictive regultions an enormous increase
in admin functions of the state now with central bureaucracy to fulfil tasks set
by adherents of liberalism
just like machinery increased uses of labour, free markets increased need for
control/regulation/intervention
but another paradox. laissez-fair economy was product of deliberate state action
but subsequent restrions started in spontaneous way! **__"Laissez-faire was
planned; planning was not"__**

!

Liberal argument always that "pure" liberalism never tried. the social reactions
always interfered. claim there was an anti liberal conspiracy. but there wasn't,
it was natural reaction of social interests to preotect themselves from
expanding market mechanism

anthropological research shows the goals for which individuals will work are
culturally determined, not purely economic

commoditzation of labour and land liquidates existing cultural institutions

famine was checked under feudalsim by noblesse oblige, clan solidarity,
regulation. but in the market system starvation emerged. in India under East
India Company famine was kept in check by monopolists. bbut under free and equal
exchange Indians perished by the millions

commoditization of land, labour, and money threatened nature, man, and
productive organization. each dealt with in next chapters

Market and Man:
- absence of threat of individual starvation that makes primitive society more
  humane than market economy, and less economic. white man's initial
  contirbution to black man's world consisted in introducing him to the uses of
  the scourge of hunger
- Owen. Coops. social approach. refused to accept division of society into
  political and economic spheres


polanyi - econ as representing social relations
polanyi: 19th cent based distinctly on economic foundation of self-regulating market which implied individual pursuit of gain as sole sufficient force for organizing all society. no room for political coordination.
