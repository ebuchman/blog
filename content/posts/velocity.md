One of the great mysteries of money is its so called velocity:




Velocity is defined most traditionally through the Equation of Exchange,
as the ratio of total spending to total amount of money: `V = PQ / M`, where V
is velocity, M is total money supply, and PQ is total spending (the product of
P, a vectors of prices, and Q, a vector of quantities of goods). 
Velocity is like a frequency - it's the number of times a unit of money is used to make a transaction. 
If there's more spending than the total money supply, the same unit of money must be used in multiple transactions.

Both total money and spending are relatively straightforward to measure, 
and thus its easy to compute velocity from them. But its more difficult to measure velocity directly.
One could imagine trying to measure velocity by giving each coin or
bank note a serial number, and recording it as part of each transaction, so you
could see how many times a given coin was literally used (and then average over
them). But it's not clear how this would apply to ledger-based or electronic systems where there are 
no distinct monetary tokens like coins, just balances in an account. So
velocity, at least in the sense that a given unit of money moves,
isn't really a measure itself, but rather something that falls out of
the identity that relates money to spending.

Another way to think about velocity is via it's inverse. If velocity is a
frequency, then its inverse is a duration. If velocity is the number of times a
unit of money is used in transactions, its inverse is the duration of time a unit of money is
held, before it's used in a transaction. This is basically liquidity demand, `D = 1/V`.
If `V = PQ / M`, then rearranging, `M = PQ / V = PQ * D`, which tells us that people do two things with money: spending and holding.

The Equation of Exchange is itself a tautology. What is is interesting is
whether it can tell us anything useful about reality. 
This domain has been largely dominated by the Quantity Theory of Money,
the theory that "total spending" in the Equation of Exchange can be decomposed
as the product of scalar aggregates - a price level and an output level - thus
yielding a model of inflationary process in the world: 
given a fixed velocity and total output, more money means higher prices.

The Quantity Theory has its origins in the [Price Revolution] of the 16th
century, as people like Copernicus began to notice the impact that huge
imports of precious metals from the Americas were having on prices. It matured
in the writings of John Locke, during the tumultuous years of English monetary
revolution at the end of the 17th century (the founding of the [Bank of England],
the [Great Recoinage]), and in the writings of David Hume,
on the eve of the explosion of capitalism towards the end of the 18th. John
Stuart Mill, one of the leading classical economists, would formalize the Equation of Exchange in the 19th century, and
Irving Fisher, who many great economists considered to be the greatest American economnist in history, 
would further flesh out the mathematics of the Quantity Theory at the start of the 20th. 
Finally, after WWII, Milton Friedman would erect the entire Monetarist school on the back of the Quantity Theory, bringing it 
to mainstream popularity, and leading to the modern
formulation of Central Banks targetting a price-level by manipulating the money
supply.

The Quantity Theory suggests that there are 4 key components of the economy
we can look at or target: the money supply, the price level ("inflation"), the output ("GDP"), and the 
velocity (inverse of "demand for money"). But it has focused us primarily on the money-supply and the price-level, 
assuming that velocity (and thus the demand for money) is largely constant, and that output (GDP) is, well, the output. 
Thus Monetary practice today is largely fixated on targetting a certain price level (eg. 2% inflation), usually by
Central Bank manipulation of the money supply (and the interest rate). But Central
Banks are finding themselves increasingly unable to meet their inflation targets
(they chronically and consistently underperform the 2% inflation standard they set for
themselves), seemingly because they are increasingly disconnected from the
actual patterns of spending in the economy. To this end, there is growing
support for a movement of "[NGDP targetting]", where Central Banks target
total nominal spending directly, rather than the price level.

The Quantity Theory has always been an extremely limitted and simplified model
of reality. For one, it assumes an underlying temporal process that translates money supply increases into higher prices.
But the Equation of Exchange says nothing about this process' dynamics. For instance, the introduction of new money into an
economy occurs in particular locations (today, primarily in banks), and, and least in principle, flows out into the rest of the
economy over time. It disproportionately benefits those closer to the source - 
this is the [Cantillon effect], well known since at least the 18th century. And in recent times, the "money"[^money] the central banks 
are creating doesn't seem to be making it out into the economy at all. 
The Quantity Theory also assumes that spending, PQ, can be neatly separated into nominal ("price level", P) and real ("output level", Q) components, as
if we can pierce the "neutral veil of money" layered over underlying "real" processes.
But money, especially in the complex credit-economy we live in today, is
by no means a neutral veil - it is a dominant force in the productive organization of society.
Money is a factor of production itself. And then there's the matter of velocity,
which adherents of the Quantity Theory generally take to be a constant. But we
know that in times of crisis, velocity collapses (the demand for money
sky-rockets). And in their attempts to crank up the money supply in recent decades, measures of velocity appear to be falling everywhere.
The Quantity Theory of Money, then, seems to be of quite limitted value. But what of velocity? Does it
even matter? Does it tell us something meaningful that spending does not?

Velocity, as we know it so far, proposes to capture a simple linear relationship
between the money supply and aggregate spending. But Wicksell showed, 
over a hundred years ago, that any amount of money,
even an infintessimally small amount, is in principle sufficient to clear all
the transactions in an economy - the velocity just needs to be arbitrarily high.
For instance, in a closed economy, where I owe you $5 and you owe me $5, then even with 
only $1 of circulating money supply, we can completely pay off our dues by
sending the $1 back and forth as many times as necessary (ie. 10).
Wicksell extends the example to a larger
society, where payment obligations build up over a period, after which everyone
assembles at a fair to send whatever amount of money exists back and forth until
everyone's debts are cleared. Velocity, then, is somehow a measure of the connectedness of the payments graph,
of the ability for money to flow through it, and for a single unit of money to
be used to clear many transactions. 

Wicksell takes the example further by introducing a bank that everyone uses, and
which issues credit (ie. "deposits") that can be used in place of money. 
In such a scenario, where there is effectively no money used for payments, as everyone uses bank credit instead, 
the velocity of money is found to be infinite (ie. spending divided by 0)! Of course today, we consider bank 
credit to be money, thus reinstating a non-zero denominator. But this gives us a
glimpse into thinking of velocity as a measure of the effectiveness of the
payments network. So much of spending today takes place on credit (eg. trade credit, credit cards, etc.), and is later
cleared by a payment of money (which is itself bank credit). The velocity of money is thus severely constrained by
the structure of the payments network, which is currently defined by the
international banking system. What

But perhaps what really
matters, beyond the simple aggregate variables of the Equation of Exchange, 
is the actual structure of monetary relationships that comprise the economy: 
the patterns of spending and the flow of payments through the economic network.

Money is where the payments are. And of the terms of the Equation of Exchange,
velocity comes closest to representing this. But the flow of money
through an economy cannot be well understood in the simplified, aggregate terms
of the Equation of Exchange, or a simple Quantity Theory layered on top. 
And the veloc


And so what ends up being measured and focused on - aggregates of the money supply, prices,
and total spending - turn out to be largely meaningless, because it provides no insight
on the underlying patterns of payment that constitute the real structure of the
economy. 

ignored, the velocity, may be the most important.

The Federal Reserve publishes charts that show the
velocity over time, by dividing GDP (spending) by some measure of the money supply, usually
M1 or M2[^money-supply]. 


But we don't mean velocity in such a simplistic sense, a mere artifact of an
identity between money and spending. Velocity ought to refer to the actual
networks of payment between parties, and the pattterns of activity across those
networks. 



So velocity is in some sense a reflection of the efficiency of the payment
system.

money can be in two places at once without being anywhere at all.

Throughout history, societies have been plagued by a chronic shortage of smaller
denomination money. The smallest units of coin were often larger than many of
the transactions engaged in by poorer people. It wasn't necessarily that there
wasn't enough money

  M2, since most of the dollars in existence are created off-shore, in the form
  of "eurodollars," which the Federal Reserve does not know how to measure.

Quantifying the price-level implies an ability to differentiate real and nominal values, 
to pierce the "veil of money". But money is, at least in the complex
credit-money economy we live in today, by no means a neutral veil. It is a
dominant force in the organization of production itself.
