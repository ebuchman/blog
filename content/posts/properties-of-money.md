*This is the introductory post in a series on the properties of money and the
tensions between them.*

It is perhaps inevitable that every philosopher of money will venture at some point
into the muck of money's notorious "properties", trying to make space for some
light. Unfortunately, many such ventures seem to result in obnoxious
arguments as to why one or the other of the properties is the most important 
feature of money. We refuse to show the complex institution of
money this level of disrespect. Instead we seek to honour each of the properties
in their true glory.

The properties of money are most commonly stated as the
Unit of Account (UoA), Medium of Exchange (MoE)
and Store of Value (SoV).[^properties-payments] Typically, in the history of economic thought, the Medium of Exchange
is taken as the most important, as economics is about exchange, and money is its
means. But the credit and Chartalist schools of the early 20th century have
experienced a renaissance in the last few decades, challenging the
hegemony of the Medium of Exchange, and pronouncing in retribution the
supremacy of the Unit of Account. Naturally, there are also those who worship the Store of Value, 
but they are more likely to be either gold bugs, crypto bros, 
rent-seeking sociopaths, or otherwise preoccupied with concern about the impending apocalypse - 
in any case, not considered polite company.

By over emphasizing the Medium of Exchange, and taking money merely as a convenience of barter,
the mainstream tradition blinded itself to the temporal structure of exchange.
They took what is fundamentally an asynchronous process, of two distinct obligations to deliver, 
and theorized it as a synchronous, simultaneous event. But one exchange is in reality *two* transfers. 
And between those transfers, no matter how close together they are, lies what we'd 
call a monetary debt - an obligation to pay something worth a monetary amount.
The spot market is an institution where it's possible to safely carry out these two
transfers back to back, as if they were simultaneous. But they never really are.

What the mainstream conception missed, despite it glaring at them in the form of 
sovereign faces on coins and bills, were problems of liquidity and legitimacy - of
credit and its security, of the ability to roll over debts, and to settle payments
when they're due. By taking money as a neutral veil, these problems disappeared
into blundering abstractions of the aggregate "supply" of a fictitious commodity called money, 
managed by all powerful central banks. But this is a gross obfuscation. Money is not some
fictitious commodity, it is an evolving web of payment obligations engulfing the world economy.
What matters is not the quantity of money, but its quality,
and [quality is defined by patterns in the payments
network](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/velocity/).
For us, money is where the payments are.

Our position, at least for the sake of this series of posts, is that money has a more singular function, 
that of denominating and clearing debts, which is to say, 
requesting and receiving payments. Money is where the payments are.

## Money as Settlement

Consider that money is an institution of settlement. By this we mean
an institution that arranges for the coordinated reduction of uncertainty in a
domain of experience. Other common institutions of settlement are war, marriage,
and law (religious and secular), and in a sense these comprise the
foundations for institutions of money. The institution of money specializes in
settlements of a "monetary variety", effectively, *payments to settle debts*.
But it could also be said that the *kind* of money we use is itself
a settlement between the various social strata on how value and wealth will
flow through society, on how we replicate patterns of inequality over time. 

Settlement is an apt word, since it
also denotes the physical settlement of a group of people in a common area,
agreeing to build their lives together in one location. Institutions of monetary settlement
are also a reflection of how we agree to build our lives together.

For the sake of our argument, let us proclaim here: 
money is for making payments, for settling debts! 
This is not to say that money is debt itself, though it can be. The distinction
between money and credit is thousands of years old, and through much of that, money meant
something material, something with no inherent counterparty
risk - generally, metal. Of course most money today is credit (bank balance sheet entries),
but it doesn't mean all money is or must be, even if, institutionally, money
exists to facilitate the issuance and settlement of debts, be they commercial debts,
fiscal debts, legal debts, religious debts, dowries, etc.

In this framing, we can understand the three properties of money as follows: the
Unit of Account allows us to denominate debts; the Medium of Exchange allows us to settle those debts, here
and now; and the Store of Value allows us to settle those debts, elsewhere or later. 
That is, armed with the
fiction of an accounting unit, we can denominate debts to one another (i.e.
extend each other credit). Then, when a debt falls due, and the creditor expects
to be repaid something with value equal to the originally denominated debt, the
debtor can conjure a means of settling the debt here and now. And as a
debtor, in order to ensure I can settle my debts in the future (in the same or
even different Unit of Accounts!), I will seek a way to store value in the meantime so I can guarantee access to 
the relevant means when the need to settle my debts arises, wherever and
whenever that might be.

## Properties and Tensions

To summarize, the properties of money can be understood as follows:

- the Unit of Account is for denominating debts
- the Medium of Exchange is for clearing debts, here and now
- the Store of Value is for clearing debts, elsewhere or later

This is all relatively straight forward. But what we'd like to explore in
this series are the tensions that lie between each pair of properties.[^inspiration]
It is within these tensions, we suspect, that money finds its character,
and that we might find a more complete understanding of how the global monetary order is
failing, and what, if anything, we might be able to do about it.

In this series, we'll consider a characterization of the tensions as follows.
Between the Unit of Account and the Medium of Exchange lies a tension between elasticity and discipline,
which gives rise to a problem of *liquidity*. Between the Medium of Exchange and the Store of Value lies a
tension between "bad" and "good" money, which gives rise to a problem of *legitimacy*.
And between the Store of Value and the Unit of Account lies a tension between deflation and inflation,
which gives rise to a problem of *solvency*:

- UoA/MoE: **liquidity** - the tension between elasticity and discipline
- MoE/SoV: **legitimacy** - the tension between "bad" and "good" money
- SoV/UoA: **solvency** - the tension between deflation and inflation

These tensions are somewhat masked today by a homogenizing institutional structure in the
global monetary order that conflates them within a single all powerful currency
unit, the dollar. But such a totalizing monetary construction is unique in the
history of monetary systems, which are characterized by a plurality of monetary
forms and substances that unbundle the properties of money and bridge across different domains and scales of
exchange. Even the dollar system has the properties of money effectively unbundled between the USD as the Unit of Account, 
the eurodollar as the Medium of Exchange, and the US Treasury Security as the Store of Value. But by running
our economies effectively blind to the underlying reality of these tensions, we have more or less
precipitated a perpetual crisis in the liquidity, legitimacy, and solvency of our monetary order. 
Surely this is something we will want to understand better.

Each of the posts that follow will explore each of the properties of money, along with one of
its tensions. First, we will look at the Unit of Account, the denominator of debts, and its tension with the Medium of Exchange, which yields
the problem of liquidity. From there we will turn to the Medium of Exchange, the clearing wheel 
of the here and now, and to its tension with the Store of Value, a repressed battle over
legitimacy. Finally, we will turn to the Store of Value, the guardian of debts to be cleared
elsewhere or later, and its tension with the Unit of Account, which strikes as an
existential question of solvency, of how we measure what we're worth. Perhaps
finally, or even throughout, we will discover something about sovereignty, about how we define who we even are.

Stay tuned.


[^properties-payments]: Sometimes "means of payment" or "means of settling debt" are considered as a
fourth property of money, but as we'll see, we'd rather think of this as actually the key
function which the standard 3 properties enable. Money isn't about exchange,
it's about settling debt, which includes its denomination, transfer, and
valuation.
