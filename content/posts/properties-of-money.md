It is the duty of every philosopher of money to at some point venture into the
muck of the notorious "three properties", and see if they can't make space for
some light. Unfortunately, many such ventures seem to reuslt in obnoxious
arguments as to why one or the other of the properties is the most important 
feature of money. We refuse to show the complex institution of
money this level of disrespect. Instead we seek to honour each of the properties
in their true glory:

{{< tweet 1551425802893496321 >}}

The properties of money are most commonly stated as the
Unit of Account (UoA), Medium of Exchange (MoE)
and Store of Value (SoV). Typically, in the history of economic thought, the MoE
is taken as the most important, as economics is about exchange, and money is its
means. But the credit and chartalist schools of the early 20th century have
experienced a renaissance in the last few decades, challenging the
hegemony of the MoE, and pronouncing in retribution the
supremacy of the UoA. There is of course also an undercurrent of those who
worship the SoV, though they are more likely to be either rent-seeking
sycophants or otherwise preoccupied with concern about the impending apocolypse - 
in either case, generally not considered polite company.

The focus of the mainstream tradition on the MoE blinded them to the temporal
structure of exchange. They took a fundamentally asynchronous process, of credit
extension and payment, and theorized it as entirely synchronous barter exchange - as if, so they say, 
money was a "netural veil."
And as that conception repeatedly failed, they introduced adhoc reactionary institutional structures to
"tame" the markets. But what they missed, despite it glaring at the them in the form of sovereign faces
on coins and bills, was the problem of liquidity - of
credit and its security, of the ability to roll over debts, and to settle payments
when they're due. The mainstream tradition has only attempted to study this as
the aggregate "supply" of a fictitious commodity called money, managed by all powerful
central banks, rather than as the actual evolving web of payment obligations engulfing the world economy 
that it is. For us, money is where the payments are.

Our position, at least for this piece, is that money is better considered as 
having a more singular function, that of denominating and clearing debts, which is to say, 
requesting and receiving payments. Money is where the payments are.
The three properties can then be understood in the way that they, and the
tensions between them, contribute to the fulfilment of payments - the
denominating and clearing of debts.

We suggest that the properties can be understood as follows: 

- the UoA is for denominating debts
- the MoE is for clearing debts, here and now
- the SoV is for clearing debts, elsewhere or later

And that between each property, lies an essential tension:

- UoA/MoE: liquidity - the tension between elasticity and discipline
- MoE/SoV: legitimacy - the tension between bad and good money
- SoV/UoA: solvency - the tension between deflation and inflation

We will begin by considering money itself, as a settlement medium. We then look at
the UoA, the denominator of debts, and its tension with the MoE, which yields
problems of liquidity. From there we turn to the MoE, the clearing wheel 
of the here and now, and to its tension with the SoV, a repressed battle over
legitmacy. Finally, we turn to the SoV, the guardian of debts to be cleared
elsewhere or later, and its tension with the UoA, which strikes as an
existential question of solvency, of how we measure what we're worth.

## Money as Settlement

Consider that money is an institution of settlement. By this we mean
an instsitution that arranges for the coordinated reduction of uncertainty in a
domain of experience. Other common institutions of settlement are war, marriage,
and law (religious and secular), and in a sense these comprise the
foundations for institutions of money. The institution of money specializes in
settlements of a "monetary variety", effectively, *payments to settle debts*.
It could also be said that the *kind* of money we use is itself
a settlement between the various social classes on how value and wealth will
flow through society. 

Settlement is a curious word, since it
also denotes the physical settlement of a group of people in a common area,
agreeing to build their lives together in one location. Monetary settlements,
too, are a reflection of how we agree to build our lives together.

Thus we proclaim: money is for making payments, for settling debts!  Money
itself is not necessarily debt, per se, though institutionally it exists largely
to facilitate the issuance and settlement of debts. This includes commercial
debts, but also fiscal debts, dowries, religious debts, etc.

Sometimes "means of payment" or "means of settling debt" are considered as a
fourth property of money, but here we rather think of these as actually the key
function which the standard 3 properties enable. Monetary exchange is generally
speaking not a simultaneous phenomenon, it often takes place as two distinct one
way payments, first of some good/service, second of some payment media - or what
we call money. Of course the order can be reversed, or it can appear practically
simultaneous, but the inherent temporal-structure of money is much clearer when
starting from a position of asynchronous payments rather than synchronous
exchange. Money is where the payments are.

In this framing, we can understand the three properties of money as follows: the
UoA allows us to denominate debts; the MoE allows us to settle those debts, here
and now; and the SoV allows us to settle those debts, elsewhere or later. 
That is, armed with the
accounting fiction of the UoA, we can denominate debts to one another (ie.
extend eachother credit). Then, when a debt falls due, and the creditor expects
to be repaid something with value equal to the originally denominated debt, the
debtor can do so by conjuring up the MoE and making a payment with it. And as a
debtor, in order to ensure I can settle my debts in the future (in the same or
different UoAs!), I will seek a way to store value (SoV) in the meantime so I can gaurantee access to 
the relevant MoE when the need to settle my debts arises.

Let us now consider more fully each property individually and the tensions between
them.

## UoA - Denominating Debts

The Unit of Account allows us to denominate debts. It is an accounting device.
Historically it appears that UoAs have their origin in broadly accessible
measurements of things in the physical world which may exist as private property - 
for instance, a head of cattle, a shell, or a handful of grain. 
UoAs were most famously standardized in the early temple
palaces of the Near East, where they seem to have been based in a standard
weight of barley - a shekel.

The UoA provides a means of doing accounting, of keeping track of resource
allocation within a society. In the early states, this took the form of
accounting for grain inventories and their redistribution throughout the
population. In so far as only grain was involved, the UoA was used to denominate
grain debts, which would be settled literally in grain. In this way, grain could
be seen as comprising all three of the UoA, the MoE, and the SoV.

However, as the UoA was effectively a standardized weight, and since weight is a
property all materials share, it didn't take much for a more convenient and
durable substance of an equivalent weight to stand in for grain.
This allowed precious metals to emerge as MoE and SoV in an
accounting system predicated on weights of grain. Notably, money in this form,
where the UoA was a standard weight of grain constituted in precious metal of an
equivalent weight as the MoE and SoV, existed for at least a couple thousand
years before the introduction of coinage in the ~7th century BC.

With the introduction of coinage, the MoE function would
gain a new prominence, while limitations on writing, numeracy, and
arithmetic would restrain growth in the capabilities of accounting systems - the key function of the UoA.
But with the discovery of Arabian mathematics and related bookeeping techniques 
by Italian merchant bankers in the ~13th century AD, new life was breathed into
the UoA, unlocking powerful new mechanisms for debt denomination to restructure
society.

With bookeeping came the flourishing of clearing and netting activities, which allow debts
to be settled by balancing txs within and across balance sheets. The MoE of
precious metals would give way to that of bank deposits. This is the Hierarchy
of Money. But the ability to do clearing and netting at each level in the hierarchy implies 
that access to a higher level of the hierarchy is only necessary in so far as 
there are *imbalances* in the payments graph being cleared in the lower level. 
If everyone I do business with uses the same bank, all my payments can be
settled on the banks balance sheet, without resorting to a higher level in the hiearchy 
(like cash or bank reserves). 

This then hints at a deep tension between the UoA and the MoE - between
the elasticity permitted by the UoA and the discipline asserted by the MoE. 
The UoA permits us to create computational spaces where we can account for debts and net out payments.
But to the extent there is insufficient bandwidth or capacity in that space,
computation must "spill" out into the MoE (spill "up" the hierarchy). 

The UoA allows debts to be denominated, but it does not in itself prescribe
how they should be settled. While many governments will endow a particular MoE
with legal tender law (eg. for banknotes and coins), other MoEs are often used
along side them (fintech, banks).
Debts can also be settled in-kind, which is to say by something else valued in the UoA
equivalently to the original debt. This implies storing value somewhere else
besides the MoE, and even bypassing the MoE altogether. This is not barter, per
se, since the two payments happen at different points in time - the first on
credit, the second later as repayment. Invoices in the UoA are still being
issued and settled, but no generally accepted MoE need come into existence at all, because opposing
payments are simply netted. Value is instead
stored in the real world, in the continuous productive capacities of the
recipricol agents. This is what allows us to do netting, to perform monetary
computation without resorting to the liquidity of an MoE.

Of course, most agents don't have fully recipricol relations like this, allowing them
to avoid payment in the MoE by just netting in the UoA. I pay my accountant for their services, 
but they don't pay me for anything (at least not
yet!), so I can't do any netting with them - I have to pay them cash. 
Again, the MoE is needed in so far as there
are imbalances in the payments graph. But every firm has many customers and many vendors, 
and collectively they continuously create and renew a vast network of payment obligations (the "trade
credit" network), which is at the core of the real economy.  
And within this network, we can ask about the patterns of flow, and in particular whether there
are closed loops ("cycles") that can be settled like this without the need for
balances in an MoE to materialize. 
If I owe Abed $10 and Abed owes Troy $6 and Troy
owes me $4, we can net out what's common ($4) from all of them, leaving everyone
only owing the difference ($6 for me and $2 for Abed) - the MoE is needed only
in so far as there are imbalances in the payment graph.

IMAGE

More anxiously, then, we might ask how the network of payment obligations
built up in the trade credit networks (and more broadly, the financial networks) might
relate to the general availability of MoE required to settle those imbalances.
Say, to the extent that obligations are not part of closed loops that can be
netted out, where and how are we to get the MoE to clear them all? Whyfore and
from where ought there to be the liquidity?

This tension, between the elasticity of the UoA and the discipline of the MoE,
is what the entire edifice of banking and central banking was
historically erected to navigate - to enable payments to continue flowing, to
keep things *liquid*. This was done first of all by forming clearing
consortia that could net out flows, and second by creating vouchers they called
"reserves" that could function as an MoE within the clearing union. Concerns
continue to abound as to the problem of responsibly issuing such reserves. 

Curiously, the history of economic thought has largely failed to theorize
correctly about this tension in the structure of the payments graph - about the
problem of liquidity - despite a complex and sophisticated payments system
developing before and alongside it in the form of Europe's great banking networks. 
Of course the bankers themselves weren't particularly keen to write treatises
divulging the secrets of their business, and often operated with more than a
flair of secrecy. Thus the discovery of economics in the academy found itself 
largely bound up in theorizing about mutual gains to trade, where trade was
conceived in the form of barter, and the temporal structure of the trade
credit and payments system that served as the actual engine of trade was practically ignored.
Instead, the cheap or practically free availability of liquidity provided by
dealers was taken for granted almost as a form of mysticism, 
until it would seize up in the recurrent
liquidity crises of the last few centuries, only to be remythologized by the
action of great priests employed by the world's central banks. 

Ability to theorize about these problems wasn't wholly absent, 
though it may, more often than not, have been overshadowed by the more
encompassing drama of political power, and thus more difficult to penetrate the
halls of America's most esteemed economic institutions.[^rockfeller] Keynes' *bancor* proposal at Bretton
Woods, which was based on EF Schumachers work on multi-lateral
clearing,[^schumacher] was a
recognition of the need to balance the global payments graph between countries.
This was of course rejected by the US, who was the world's largest creditor at the time.
But not 25 years later, when the US had already become the world's largest
debtor, and thus pushed for the creation of new reserve assets at the IMF (the
SDRs), the European representatives insisted that there was no need for more
reserve assets, but rather a need to balance the payments
graph.[^superimperialism] In both cases, Europe rolled over. The legacy of the
US incompetence in matters of sound finance persist to this day, with the
Federal Reserve capable of doing little more than manipulating quantities of
bank reserves and the interest rates paid on them. That the Federal Reserve, if
not so many other central banks, has any shred of legitimacy left in its
management of monetary affairs is a travesty.[^fed-money]

Fortunately, this negligence is being addressed by a new generation of 
scholarship which puts the problem of liquidity front and
center in understanding money and banking - for instance,
Perry Mehrling's "[Money View]" and his excellent [MOOC] on
the matter. But perhaps even more promising is what we, at [Informal Systems], are calling 
Collaborative Finance, which is a new science of the payments graph and liquidity injection. 
The CoFi perspective is focused on understanding the payments graph itself -
mapping it, finding cycles, clearing them, and encouraging their sustainable growth.
But it also gives us new insights into the optimal injection of liquidity into
the graph - namely, liquidity can be injected in ways that optimize for network
level properties, rather than being injected on an ad-hoc and discretionary
basis to individual nodes by banks. This has the potential to transform the
realm of commnunity financing and banking, not to mention how we measure
sustainable economic growth itself.

At the heart of this thinking is the problem of imbalances in the payment graph - 
what can't be accounted for and thus cleared in the UoA alone,
and how it must "spill out" into the domain of the MoE. We turn to the MoE
next.

## MoE - Settling Debts, Here and Now

The Medium of Exchange allows us to settle our debts, here and now.
Traditionally, as we've noted, the MoE is taken as the 
primary property of money - not as a way to settle asynchronous debts, 
but as a the means to engage in indirect but synchronous exchange. In this view,
the UoA is largely taken for granted as a mere numeraire, a simple mathematical
convenience for commensurability, and money itself is largely
dismissed as a "neutral veil" over the "real" world of production and trade.

This is of course obtuse and has led to repeated failures in the ability of the 
mainstream economic discipline to understand the repeated monetary and economic crises. 

Let us rather consider that the MoE is itself a map from the SoV to the UoA. 
The production of MoE is an active process in which endowment of the UoA with the SoV
is made manifest. The MoE lets us clear debt that we can't otherwise clear with accounting alone
by making "value" conveniently accessible in units of the UoA. It provides a way
of tiding over imbalances in the payment graph by drawing on the value source to 
settle debts here and now. It resolves an inherent uncertainty about dynamics in
the UoA, providing a way to settle payments now we're not otherwise sure we want to leave
for later. It provides liquidity, a hedge against the uncertainty lying awake in our future
payment obligations.

An imbalance in the payments graph means that there are nodes receiving more
than they're paying, and vice versa - there's nodes saving more than they're spending (in
the current moment), and others spending more than they're saving. 
A node can only continuously benefit from an imbalance if either (1) others are
at a continuous detriment or (2) new money is being created. Perhaps obvious,
but worth restating. If we can't manage
to balance the payments graph, we have to either oppress people or create money - usually both. 
But this framing emphasizes whats at stake when we're talking
about creating money, about provisioning of the MoE. 

For a few thousand years, the primary MoE was metal coins. This is not to say
all commerce was done using coins - much of it was done on credit, from simple
tabs at the pub to complex networks of bills of exchange, there were many early forms in the
hierarchy of money. But at the end of the day, 
metal coins were a dominant means for final settlement of imbalances in the payment graph.

Coins are a rather direct example of how the MoE maps an SoV to the UoA. The
metal as SoV is stored literally in the coin itself. But there are many other
MoE, from coffee beans to cattle to shells to wampum, each of which maps an SoV
to the UoA in a unique way. Money is not just about trade, but the general
phenomenon of making payments and settling debts. 

The MoE functions as a kind of proof, proof that an amount of the SoV, denominated in the UoA, 
is properly embedded in the medium at hand. Coins are stamped. Bills are signed.
Bitcoin are hashed. Monetary objects are generally speaking verifiable,
and conterfeiting is the art of trying to pass fake proofs. But the necessity
of being a proof implies a cost, which limits the general accessibility of the MoE.
MoEs inherit a scarcity from the SoV and the proof process that limits their accessibility, that puts
them in tension with the UoA, as we've seen. If the UoA holds the key to elasticity, 
to magically expand balance sheets and issue credit, the MoE introduces the harsh reality of 
discipline by attempting to ground the growth of UoA denominated mechanics in the availability
of circulating media containing the SoV. 
The UoA in this sense is a Public Good: non-excludable and non-rivalrous.
But the MoE is a Common Pool Resource: non-excludable and rivalrous.

One curious phenomenon is that computation spaces made possible by the UoA can
themselves become substrates for new MoEs. This is what gives us the hierarchy of
money. Bank balance sheets, which were
originally elaborations of the UoA on a base MoE of coins in a vault, would
eventually come to be regarded as the primary MoE themselves. For a currency
user in Canada, say, we could consider three levels in the hierarchy of money,
each effectively a distinct MoE. At the
lowest level in the hierarchy is the primary MoE for the user: a bank deposit.
For the bank, its primary MoE is bank reserves with its central bank. And for the
central bank, its primary MoE is the world reserve currency: USD deposits at the
Federal Reserve.
At each level in the hierarchy lies an institution which must
continuously produce proofs of the validity of the MoE, of its legitimacy.

For much of history, the stuff of the MoE was generally speaking freely
accessible, though obtaining it demonstrated some amount of work - whether that
be braiding wampum, collecting shells, or mining gold. We can think of this as
an early kind of what cryptocurrency people call Proof of Work. 
In the case of coins, of course it would be highly non-trivial and unlikely for the average peasant to
mine their own gold, and mining itself was a slave laden afair, 
but generally speaking, a form of "free minting" operated,
where anyone could take bullion to the mint, however they acquired it, and have
it turned into legitimate coins (at the cost of some intrinsic value, for the gain of some
nominal value). This meant provision of the MoE was generally accessible,
though it was conditional on the availability of the metals themselves, which of course was a
sufficiently strong condition that there was almost always a chronic shortage of
coin, especially for smaller payments.

That the MoE was coin, and that most of the SoV was held by private individuals
(rather than states), made the production of coinage always a kind of
public-private partnership. Private individuals brought metal to the mint, and
the mint, with blessing of the state, made it into coins - the MoE of the
realm. With the rise of banking, the form of the public-private partnership
would change, but it would remain a partnership nonetheless. Pressure on the MoE
to evolve thus comes from both the public and the private sector - from the
public sector, usually to improve the ability to finance war, and from the
private sector, usually to improve the ability to conduct commerce (which
broadly speaking we might try to understand as improving
[velocity](https://ebuchman.github.io/posts/velocity/). 

Such public-private collaboration permeates the entire essence of money.
And as alluded to, the kind of money we use is itself a form of settlement between
the various sectors. But the problem of provisioning the MoE,
and essentially, the element of choice or diversity in what the MoE could be,
highlights a key tension between the MoE and the SoV - that of legitimacy. 
While the structure of accounting (the UoA) is basically declared unilaterally by the State, 
and the nature of value (the SoV) can be decided by each individual, the MoE
requires a continuous dance between the too to guarantee its legitimacy.

This tension materializes perhaps most clearly as the problem of "good" and
"bad" money, the relation between legal tender laws and private valuations.
On the one hand, if a "bad" (ie. debased) money is made legal tender, it will drive out the "good" money -
this is Gresham's Law. On the other hand, if given the choice between which
money to use, people and societies will generally gravitate towards the "good"
money, the money that better holds its value - this is Thier's Law. 
While Gresham's law historically pushed higher
valued metallic coins out of circulation, Thier's law leads to things like
clandestine adoption of USD or Bitcoin.

This tension between the MoE and the SoV is where cryptocurrencies live and
breath. They have yet to crack the nut of the UoA just yet, and are mostly
piggybacking on the USD for now, but the innovation in proof technology - for
generating a MoE containing proof of a kind of value storage - is astounding. 
But what do we even mean by value storage? We turn to that next.


## SoV - Settling Debts, Elsewhere or Later 

The Store of Value allows us to settle our debts, elsewhere or later.
That is, as a value store, it can be transported across space to 
settle payments in another UoA, and it can be transported across time to 
settle payments in the future. It is our hedge against space and time.

If the MoE maps the SoV into the UoA so we can clear a debt here and now, the
SoV keeps that debt clearing capacity safe for later. While the MoE hedges the
uncertainty in our payment obligations within a given UoA, the SoV hedges the
uncertainty of the UoA itself. The MoE hedges uncertainty *in* the
payment graph, but the SoV hedges the uncertainty *of* the payment graph.

What does it mean to store value? Theories of value are notoriously fickle, and
we will do well to proceed with caution. We have here been considering money as
a kind of computational phenomenon - the payments graph. In this graph, the MoE
and SoV play distinct roles in resolving uncertainties about future obligations
in the graph. We might consider a theory of value, then, to proceed from a
consideration of its relationship with obligations - which is to say,
commitments to fulfill particular outcomes in a particular time - in other
words, to control the future.

The most straightforward way to control the future is by violence. Simply be
stronger and more brutal than anything or anyone you might encounter and need to subdue.
This strategy has been a mainstay of human history, and it has given
overwhelming emphasis to stores of value that are effective in commanding political violence,
which is where precious metals in particular have excelled. 
As Colin Drumm has put it, metal in the coin is the King issuing an option on
rebellion, for the baron can melt his coins for metal and hire foreign
mercenaries. But the ultimate success
of the strategy of violence to control the future, while always a threat, is not
guaranteed. If not defeated on the ground of political awakening, it is ultimately defeated by
Nature herself, against whose strength and brutality, especially on a global
scale, and even more so while being attacked, is anything we mesely humans can control or predict. 

Nature, then, introduces a fundamental uncertainty that threatens the stability
of any payments graph. To store value is to hedge that
uncertainty, which can only be meaningfully done through the construction of
some elaborated relationship with Nature herself. The SoV becomes a reflection
of the common denominator in man's relationship to nature. For a very long time,
that was captured by precious metals - by institutions of mining, metallurgy,
measurement, and coinage. More recently, we are playing with a
strange theological substance made possible by double entry bookeeping and the
angelic fiction of the corporation - we have lifted the SoV function from the
institutions of precious metal to the instsitutions of the corporate balance
sheet. This represents a tectonic shift in the relationship between man and
nature, and the way that relationship was written into the grooves of society at
large.

That the value system chosen for the SoV is a kind of "common denominator", 
we can naturally ask, common at what scale? In principle, there is a big difference
between what I have "in common" with my neighbour compared to what I might have
in comon with someone on the other side of the planet. True, the ravages of
globalization have ameliorated that somewhat, but the physicality of our existances and
the problems of energy and transport constrain us such that we do have something
more in common with our neighbour than our pen pal, and that is, for lack of a
better word, our local Nature. We might consider, then, that our monetary system
could be storing value at difference scales, differently according to the
commonolaties we face at each scale and the local uncertainties we need to
hedge. 

This observation has not been lost on the history of monetary experiments, and
more than one European nation has found itself trying to issue currency backed
by Land[^land-notes] - that is, where land, rather than precious metal, serves as the SoV. 
These cases tend to end in disaster, not least because of the inability to meaningfully
redeem a banknote (MoE) for the land (SoV) it supposedly represented. Redemption
is the means of "challenging" the proof of the MoE, and the presence of
regular and consistentent redemption activity often serves as a guarantor
of financial soundness. 

More generally, we might say that historical land owners (say feudal lords)
could also hedge the uncertainty of the payments graph by storing value in their
estate. This does not mean they used their estate as an SoV in a monetary system
per se, though they could and did use components of their estate to
settle various debts, for instance by selling off a piece of their land, or even
by marrying off their daughter. But the self-sufficiency of an estate is itself
a hedge against the uncertainties of the existence of a payments system, and in
this sense, we might take the ultimate store of value to be the self-sufficient
community.

What are we to say about the relation between such an ideal store of value, in
self-sustaining natural and social capital, and the necessities of a SoV for a monetary system?
Obviously there is the problem of constructing the MoE in a way that it
meaningfully represents the value stored, and is redeemable for it. And a sound
system must have regular and healthy run ins with redemption.[^free-banking] Exactly how to go
about structuring such systems remains an open question.

Answering these question will require dramatically improved ways of theorizing
and making money. Two developments stand out in this regard. The first are the
cryptocurrency communities, where experimentation abounds as to how to issue
tokens redeemable for collectively generated functionality. Cryptocurrencies
contain an impressive underbely of meaningful innovation in monetary design, but
they are also awash in pathological rent-seeking - of course, early banking was no different. 
The second is the MMT community, which is trying to develop a more serious economics
of how monetary media should be provisioned against the current realtiy of the
production system. In its worst, MMT is naive communism in new garb, but at its
best, it's a genuine attempt to integrate the various heterodox schools into a
more sustainable political economy. In any case, MMT and cryptocurrencies appear
as almost archetypal hostile siblings, wrestling over the future of money (see
my [post][mmt] on the matter).

... TODO ...

Both cryptocurrencies and MMT raise questions about a tension between the SoV
and the UoA.

- value stored in capital stock. uoa/sov
- self sufficiency (but war)
- UoA/SoV of modern econ
- money without MoE
- storing value lets us clear without MoE
- encoding system
- inflation/deflation. different for different parts at diff times
- the tension, solvency.


---

Earlier we noted the possibility of monetary settlement in-kind, of settling a
debt denominated in the UoA by producing something else, something not the MoE,
with an equivalent value in the UoA. We mentioned that here value was stored
somewhere outside the MoE, in a form which never even needed to manifest in the
MoE, and which therefore availed itself of the "common" SoV. This possibility
highlights the reltionship between the UoA and the SoV, and the tension that
lies between them.

Between the UoA (denominating debts) and the SoV (clearing debts, later) lies
the tension of inflation and deflation, which reflects how the UoA "dissipates"
or "accumulates" from the value store over time, as conditions require.  The UoA needs
to inflate to ease the pain of clearing failures (ie.  insufficient provision of
MoE to clear UoA denominated debt). And it needs to deflate to reflect genuine
productivity gains and to support stability of trade.  Around this tension
revolves the dance of entrepreneurs and workers seeking to allocate the risks
and rewards of monetary organization so that they can afford the output of their
collective production.
