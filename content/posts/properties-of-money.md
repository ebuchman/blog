It is the duty of every philosopher of money to at some point venture into the
muck of the notorious "three properties", and see if they can't make space for
some light. Unfortunately, many such ventures seem to reuslt in obnoxious
arguments as to why one or the other of the properties is the most important 
feature of money. We refuse to show the complex institution of
money this level of disrespect. Instead we seek to honour each of the properties
in their true glory:

The properties of money are most commonly stated as the
Unit of Account (UoA), Medium of Exchange (MoE)
and Store of Value (SoV).
These three properties are generally taken to occur together in a single medium, 
like a precious metal coin, but in reality they are often decoupled. Banknotes,
for instance, decoupled the precious metal SoV from the UoA and MoE expressed in
the banknote by stashing the metal in bank vaults. Modern Chile, as another
example, decouples the UoA (the Unidad de Fomento) from the MoE (the Chilean Peso) by
having the government publish the exchange rate between the two on a daily basis - 
prices are denominated in the UoA (UF), but payments are made in the MoE (the peso).
The global monetary system can also be understood as having decoupled the
properties of money. The UoA is the US Dollar (USD). The MoE consists primarily of a strange substance - 
bank balance sheet capacity - that might be best referred to as the "Eurodollar". And the SoV
is US Treasury securities.

If our goal is to make better money, which it ought to be, then we must first
understand more fully the nature, theory, and history of these properties - 
and in particular, the tensions between them. 

## Money as Settlement

We begin by considering money as an institution of settlement. By this we mean
an instsitution that arranges for the coordinated reduction of uncertainty in a
domain of experience. Other common institutions of settlement are war, marriage,
and law (religious and secular). The institution of money specializes in
settlements of a "monetary variety", effectively, *payments to settle debts*.
It could also be said that the *kind* of money we use is itself
a settlement between the various social classes on how value and wealth will
flow through society. 

Settlement is a curious word, since it
also denotes the physical settlement of a group of people in a common area,
agreeing to build their lives together in one location. Monetary settlements are
also a reflection of how we agree to build our lives together.

Roughly speaking then, money is for making payments; for settling debts.  Money
itself is not necessarily debt, per se, though institutionally it exists largely
to facilitate the issuance and settlement of debts. This includes commercial
debts, but also fiscal debts, dowries, religious debts, etc.

Sometimes "means of payment" or "means of settling debt" are considered as a
fourth property of money, but here we rather think of these as actually the key
function which the standard 3 properties enable. Monetary exchange is generally
speaking not a simultaneous phenomenon, it often takes place as two distinct one
way payments, first of some good/service, second of some payment media - or what
we call money. Of course the order can be reversed, or it can appear practically
simultaneous, but the inherent temporal-structure of money is much clearer when
starting from a position of asynchronous payments rather than synchronous
exchange. Money is where the payments are.

In this framing, we can understand the three properties of money as follows: the
UoA allows us to denominate debts; the MoE allows us to settle those debts, now;
and the SoV allows us to settle those debts, later or somewhere else. That is, armed with the
accounting fiction of the UoA, we can denominate debts to one another (ie.
extend eachother credit). Then, when a debt falls due, and the creditor expects
to be repaid something with value equal to the originally denominated debt, the
debtor can do so by conjuring up the MoE and making a payment with it. And as a
debtor, in order to ensure I can settle my debts in the future (in the same or
different UoAs!), I will seek a way to store value (SoV) in the meantime so I can gaurantee access to 
the relevant MoE when the need to settle my debts arises.

Let us consider more fully each property individually and the tensions between
them.

## UoA - Denominating Debts

The Unit of Account allows us to denominate debts. 
Historically it appears that UoAs have their origin in broadly accessible
measurements of the physical world - for instance, a head of cattle, a shell, or
a handful of grain. UoAs were most famously standardized in the early temple
palaces of the Near East, where they seem to have been based in a standard
weight of barley - a shekel.

The UoA provides a means of doing accounting, of keeping track of resource
allocation within a society. In the early states, this took the form of
accounting for grain inventories and their redistribution throughout the
population. In so far as only grain was involved, the UoA was used to denominate
grain debts, which would be settled literally in grain. In this way, grain could
be seen as comprising all three of the UoA, the MoE, and the SoV.

However, as the UoA was effectively a standardized weight, and since weight is a
property all materials share, it didn't take much for a more convenient and
durable substance of an equivalent weight to stand in for grain.
This allowed precious metals to emerge as MoE and SoV in an
accounting system predicated on weights of grain. Notably, money in this form,
where the UoA was a standard weight of grain constituted in precious metal of an
equivalent weight as the MoE and SoV, existed for at least a couple thousand
years before the introduction of coinage in the ~7th century BC.

With the introduction of coinage, the MoE function would
gain a new prominence, and limitations on writing, numeracy,
and arithmetic would limit growth in the capabilities of accounting systems - the key function of the UoA.
With the discovery of Arabian mathematics and related bookeeping techniques 
by Italian merchant bankers in the ~13th century AD, new life was breathed into
the UoA, unlocking powerful new mechanisms for debt denomination to restructure
society.

With bookeeping came the flourishing of clearing and netting activities, which allow debts
to be settled by balancing txs within and across balance sheets. The MoE of
precious metals would gave way to that of bank deposits. This is the Hierarchy
of Money. But the ability to do clearing at each level in the hierarchy implies 
that access to a higher level of the hierarchy is only necessary in so far as 
there are *imbalances* in the payments graph being cleared in the lower level. 
And thus there is a deep tension between the UoA and the MoE.

While the UoA allows debts to be denominated, it does not in itself prescribe
how they should be settled, and does not necessarily require a generally
accepted MoE to settle them. Debts can be settled in kind, which is to say by something else valued in the UoA
equivalently to the original debt.  This implies storing value somewhere else
besides the MoE, and even bypassing the MoE altogether. This is not barter, per
se, since the two payments happen at different points in time - the first on
credit, the second later as repayment. Invoices in the UoA are still being
issued and settled, but no MoE need come into existence at all. Value is instead
stored in the real world, in the continuous productive capacities of the
recipricol agents.

Of course, most agents don't have recipricol relations like this, allowing them
to avoid payment in the MoE. I pay my accountant for their services, 
but they don't pay me for anything (at least not
yet), so I can't do any netting with them. Again, the MoE is needed in so far as there
are imbalances in the payments graph. But every firm has many customers and many vendors, 
and collectively they
continuously create and renew a vast network of payment obligations (the "trade
credit" network), which is at the core of the real economy.  And within this
network, we can ask about the patterns of flow, and in particular whether there
are closed loops ("cycles") that can be settled like this without the need for
balances in an MoE to materialize. If I owe Abed $10 and Abed owes Troy $6 and Troy
owes me $4, we can net out what's common ($4) from all of them, leaving everyone
only owing the difference ($6 for me and $2 for Abed) - the MoE is needed only
in so far as there are imbalances in the payment graph.

More anxiously, perhaps, we might ask how the network of payment obligations
built up in the trade credit networks (and latter the financial networks) might
relate to the general availability of MoE required to settle those obligations.
Say, to the extent that obligations are not part of closed loops that can be
netted out, where and how are we to get the MoE to clear them all? 

Between the UoA (denominating debts) and the MoE (clearing debts, now) is the
tension of discipline and elasticity - the question of ensuring there is enough
MoE available to clear all the debt denominated in the UoA as it comes due. This
tension is what the entire edifice of banking and central banking was
historically erected to navigate - to enable payments to continue flowing.

Curiously, the history of economic thought has largely failed to theorize
correctly about this tension in the structure of the payments graph, despite a
complex and sophisticated payments system developing before and along side it in
the form of Europe's great banking networks. Though the discovery of economics
was largely bound up in theorizing about mutual gains to trade, trade was
conceived largely in the form of barter, and the temporal structure of the trade
credit system that served as the actual engine of trade was practically ignored.
Instead, the cheap or practically free availability of liquidity was taken for
granted almost as a form of mysticism, until it would seize up in the recurrent
liquidity crises of the last few centuries, only to be remythologized by the
action of great priests employed by the world's central banks. It is no wonder
everyone is so confused about things.



- if you can't cancel, then you need the MoE
- inability to "account" well enough forces you to move to physical accounting
  in the MoE
- tension to the MoE:
    - banking. 
    - economic history.

- uoa lets you do accounting. if you dont have enough bandwidth your computation
  overflows into the physical world where it uses MoE to complete the accounts.
  "liquidity". offloaded into moe in real world. taken for granted. 

  moe is physical manifestation of clearing - allows to offload from conceptual
  tracking apparatus to material world since not enough info bandiwth in
  tracking to do accoutning job necessary, computation offloaded into moe in
  real world. taken for granted. global monetary system cant take for granted -
  offloading computation, computation has a huge cost. you think bitcoins
  wasteful ?

## MoE  - Settling Debts now with the UoA
- traditiionally taken as main property of money. facilitates exchange.
- medium is a map from SoV to UoA. process that embeds the UoA in the SoV
- lets us clear todays debts we cant clear with accounting alone
- moe needed for settlement purposes
- "liquidity"
- for few thousand years, it was coins. not all commerce as coins, done on
  credit using UoA on balance sheets - bar tabs, etc. but coins were main
  settlement media. maybe get paid once a year
- moe was limitted. coins. long time
- from moe to sov: uoa was a weight. moe maps to sov. bridge between uoa/sov.
  historically, sov has been metal.
- not justs metal - indigenous: cattle, shells, wampum, etc.
- not just about trade. settling debts.
- moe allows transfer of value to settle debt in the uoa
- what looks like key function to neoclassical is a bridge between the "actual"
  2 functions
- moe is a transfer medium. 
- looks like a neutral veil.
- selection of moe an actual problem
- tension to sov
- how does it transfer value? how embeds it ? 
- interface with state. but generally "privately" provisioned.
    - individuals chose token to use
- greshams law. two moes that bridge differently from value to uoa
- thiers law. not quite an inverse. if given chose, choice moe that stores more
  value.
- this is where bitcoin lives. between moe and sov. no uoa function. better
  transfer of value.

SoV - 
- sov is for clearing debts later or somewhere else (different uoa)
    - different time or different unit of account
- hedge against UoA/MoE system failing.
- barrons, inflation. 
- save over time (hedge inflation), save over space (hedge war)
- econ thinks moe is most important. so then it can ignore it. takes UoA for
  granted as numeraire. tries to proceed with "utils" as value doing economics
  in a barter system.
- hedge against time and space. 
- precious metals. early private property. dowrys. early prestige. 
- served role well - account was weight. value is "valuable thing with that
  weight"
- moe allwoss toyu to transfer value. comes with SoV to give formulation
- sov was precious metals
- reflection of ability to do metallurgy, mining, and written counting.  coins
  are pinacle achievement of iron age metallurgy plus writing
- can we do democracy without sslavery? can we internalize our reproduction
  costs?
- how to store value ?
- sov in the metals and the relationships that produced and maintained the
  metals. mints.s
- metals was how you command resources
- value also stored in estates. can be used to clear debts
- marriage as settlement. almost monetarily. arranged. children used as means of
  payment. settle debts, make arrangements. debtss not denominated in UoA. makes
  it not money
- atoms are princesses.
- build the prestige of the atom without things being priced in it. value of
  block space.
- increasingly value gets stored in capital stock. bring us back to relation
  between sov and uoa
- sov is a hedge. barrons. gold. bitcoin (current inflation is deflation)
-  uoa. inflation/deflation. economics


tension in all 3. need new econ
- uoa/moe: problem of clearing. money view.
- moe/sov: payments infra. engineering. tech that delviers the sov.
- uoa/sov: where trad econ tried to lodge. doesnt undersstand thatss what itss
  doing. thinks only the moe matters, so can proceed to ignore it, and try t odo
  work on uoa/sov new theoory of currency areas. ecological econ.


Conclusion - Settling Up
