title: "The Properties of Money"

Many authors have considered the "three properties of money": Unit of Account
(UoA), Medium of Exchange (MoE), and Store of Value (SoV). There are torturous
debates about which might somehow be the most important - say, MoE for
the neoclassicals, and UoA for the credit theorists and chartalists. Forgive me
for venturing forth into this muck.

## Money as Settlement

One framing that I think gives some clarity to the problem is to rather begin from 
a consideration of money as an institution of settlement, and that the
settlements it specializes in are those of a "monetary variety" - ie. payments
to settle debts. It could also be said that the *kind* of money we use 
is itself a settlement between the various social classes on how value and
wealth will flow through society. Another major institution of settlement is the
military, which exacts settlements through violence, in contrast to the
seemingly more peacable settlements of the monetary system (developed though
they typically are upon an edifice of military settlement).
Settlement is a curious word, since it also denotes the physical settlement of a
group of people in a common area, agreeing to build their lives together in one
location. Monetary settlements are also a reflection of how we agree to build our lives together.

Roughly speaking then, money is for making payments; for settling debts. 
Money itself is not necessarily debt, per se, though institutionally it 
exists largely to facilitate the issuance and settlement of debts.

Sometimes "means of payment" or "means of settling debt" are considered as a fourth property of money, 
but here I rather think of these as actually the
key function which the standard 3 properties enable. Monetary exchange is generally
speaking not a simultaneous phenomenon, it often takes place as two distinct one
way payments, first of some good/service, second of some payment media - or what
we call money. Of course the order can be reversed, or it can appear practically
simultaneous, but the inherent temporal-structure of money is much clearer when
starting from a position of asynchronous payments rather than synchronous
exchange. Money is where the payments are.

In this framing, we can understand the three properties of money as follows: 
the UoA allows us to denominate debts; the MoE
allows us to settle those debts, now; and the SoV allows us to settle those
debts, later. That is, armed with the accounting fiction of the UoA, we can denominate
debts to one another (ie. extend eachother credit). Then, when a debt falls due, 
and the creditor expects to be repaid something with value equal to the originally
denominated debt, the debtor can do so by conjuring up the MoE and making a
payment with it. And as a debtor, in order to ensure I can settle my debts in
the future, I will seek a way to store value (SoV) in the meantime so I can gaurantee
access to the MoE when the need to settle my debts arises.

## Settling the Payments Graph

But there are other ways to settle a debt than by using the MoE. It can be settled in
kind, which is to say by something else valued in the UoA equivalently to the original debt.
This implies storing value somewhere else besides the MoE, and even bypassing
the MoE altogether. This is not barter, per se, since the two payments happen at different points in
time - the first on credit, the second later as repayment. 
Invoices in the UoA are still being issued and settled, but no MoE need come into
existence at all. Value is instead stored in the real world, in the continuous productive
capacities of the recipricol firms.

Of course, most firms don't have recipricol relations like this. I pay my
accountant for their services, but they don't pay me for anything (at least not yet). But 
every firm has many customers and many vendors, and collectively they
continuously create and renew a vast network of payment obligations (the "trade credit" network), 
which is at the core of the real economy.
And within this network, we can ask about the patterns of flow, and in
particular whether there are closed loops ("cycles") that can be settled like this 
without the need for balances in an MoE to materialize.

More anxiously, perhaps, we might ask how the network of payment obligations
built up in the trade credit networks (and latter the financial networks) 
might relate to the general availability of MoE required to settle those obligations. Say, 
to the extent that obligations are not part of closed loops that can be netted out, 
where and how are we to get the MoE to clear them all? 

## Settlement Tensions

These sorts of questions highlight the tensions that exist between the
three different properties of money. Let's look at each.

Between the UoA (denominating debts) and the MoE (clearing debts, now) 
is the tension of discipline and elasticity - 
the question of ensuring there is enough MoE
available to clear all the debt denominated in the UoA as it comes due. This
tension is what the entire edifice of banking and central banking was
historically erected to navigate - to enable payments to continue flowing.

Curiously, the history of economic thought has largely failed to theorize
correctly about this tension in the structure of the payments graph, despite a complex and sophisticated payments
system developing before and along side it in the form of Europe's great banking
networks. Though the discovery of economics was largely bound up in theorizing
about mutual gains to trade, trade was conceived largely in the form of barter,
and the temporal structure of the trade credit system that served as the actual
engine of trade was practically ignored. Instead, the cheap or practically free availability of 
liquidity was taken for granted almost as a form of mysticism, until it would
seize up in the recurrent liquidity crises of the last few centuries, only to be
remythologized by the action of great priests employed by the world's central
banks. It is no wonder everyone is so confused about things.

Between the UoA (denominating debts) and the SoV (clearing debts, later) 
lies the tension of inflation and deflation, which reflects how the UoA
"dissipates" or "accumulates" from the SoV over time, as conditions require.
The UoA needs to inflate to ease the pain of clearing failures (ie.
insufficient provision of MoE to clear UoA denominated debt). And it needs to
deflate to reflect genuine productivity gains and to support stability of trade.
Around this tension revolves the dance of entrepreneurs and workers seeking to 
allocate the risks and rewards of monetary organization so that they can afford
the output of their collective production.

... economics ... 

Between the MoE (clearing debts, now) and the SoV (clearing debts, later) 
lies the tension between "bad" and "good" money, which reflects the relationship
between legal tender laws and private valuations. 
On the one hand, if a "bad" (ie. debased) money is made legal tender, it will drive out the "good" money - 
this is Gresham's Law. On the other hand, if given the choice between which money to use, people and
societies will generally gravitate towards the "good" money - this is Thier's
Law. While Gresham's law historically pushed higher valued metallic coins out of
circulation, Thier's law leads to things like clandestine adoption of USD or
Bitcoin.

## Settlement Configurations


MoE/SoV tension also has spending/saving tension?

- MoE/UoA: elasticity/discipline. enough moe to clear the debts. merchant class
- UoA/SoV: inflation/deflation. enough inflation to ease the pain of clearing.
    (MoE/UoA) failures. enough deflation to capture productivity gains. labour class
- MoE/SoV: bad/good money. greshams law. payment in kind. 



How do we ensure the SoV can be
converted into MoE and the MoE contains enough (and only enough) of the SoV to
circulate well? 


The tendency to take liquidity and the MoE for granted led to a conception of
money as a "neutral veil" over a real world of production and trade, which was
itself subject to the forces of supply and demand being formalized by the
neoclassical economists.

central banks lurching from crisis to crisis
badgehot reality check. tries to say free banking is best. hold accountable

central banks emerge to ease UoA/MoE tension. elasticity/discipline
never understood liquidity problem. took dealers for granted. didnt understand
what they do. got away from them.

provision of MoE has been largely private affair.

confusion re bank notes vs bank deposits. both MoE. governed by different rules
(Peels)
worked to build up trust/liquidity in the banking system. deposits.

liquidity as reflection of inability to hedge uncertainty

replication via lineage (vertical) and via trade (horizontal)
infatuated with trade, but still dominated by lineage, power

honest benefits to trade requires proper accounting for factors of production.
right ownership structures. totally broken.

MoE as abstraction around uncertainty
ideally its minimized. minimize amount needed for uncertainty
not so much about reducing uncertainty as increasing anti fragility

heroin shocks. CB injections. play out over decades instead of days. addicted to
liquidity. in ability to care for selves, clear loops.

to clear loops, need togive back to creditors in future. barter spread out over
time.

debt should be a loop. but specialization. larger loops

store value in production chain, bypass MoE. can still grow.
flows get bigger together. sustainable growth.
savings based lending. but not saving in MoE, saving in productive capacity.
want MoE ultimately redeemable somehow. 

need to support flow from outside into the system ? buy the MoE. redeem it.
maybe based on clean water/air ? need to produce clean air to get access

need access to MoE to clear. where to get? pocket, outside, mutual credit.


growth of trade. money supply should relate to it. how to measure demand? cant
subject purchasing power itself to supply/demand. dangerous

power

econ not science. ethics/philsoophy. patterns of behaviour. accounting,
industry. 

inability to clear: due to hoarding + irresponsibility. both bad.
safety vs liveness?
accumulating balances a sign of "sickness"

liquidity abstracts over problems of uncertainty.
fed liquidity doesnt make it to real economy.
banks, hedge funds, stock markets, treasury. not real economy.

fed may come to own the cities with munibond facility. lead to constitutional
crisis ? monetizing municipal debt.

liquidity is about tiding over the payments graph until it can be closed later
liquidity needs to be based in productive structure of payments graph

two ways to repliucate over time: vertical (lineage - kings/families), horizontal (trade - self
replicating loops of exchange)
lineages dominate.
distracted by trade. took for grsanted. unlocking it within lineages just got
usurped by capitalism

how to bust up?

liquidity a reflection of abiulity to deal with uncertainty

--
trade as barter leads to neutral veil of money 

In this framing, we could say:

- the UoA allows us to denominate debts
- the MoE allows us to settle them, now
- the SoV allows us to settle them, later

It is no doubt that today's instsitutions of money are deeply troubled, and that the
purported experts have lost the plot. Central banking has come to resemble more
a divination cult than any meaningfully valid scientific or engineering pursuit. It's a
tragedy, really. But it's our duty to understand it, call it out and formulate something
better.

If we look at the current global monetary system, it can be decomposed rather straightforwardly 
according to the three properties of money. 
The UoA is the US Dollar (USD). The MoE consists primarily of a strange substance - 
bank balance sheet capacity - that might be best referred to as the
"Eurodollar". And the SoV is US Treasuries. People all over the world denominate
their debts using the USD, they clear them using balances in the
eurodollar system (the global network of banks), and store excess balances in
the Treasury market (so they can clear debts later).



- banking created for war vs banking created for finance
- uoas generally standardized by the state  
    - start from some "common" measurement
    - state standardizes
    - but there's multiply states ...

Money is a complex institution that takes its place among 
religion and language as a principal binding agent for human societies.
