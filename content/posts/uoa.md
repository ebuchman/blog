*This is part I in a [series on the properties of
money](/properties-of-money)*

In the introduction we outlined that money is for making payments - for settling
debts - and that its properties can be defined functionally:

- the _Unit of Account_ is for denominating debts
- the _Medium of Exchange_ is for clearing debts, here and now
- the _Store of Value_ is for clearing debts, elsewhere or later

We also introduced the tensions between them:

- _UoA/MoE_: **liquidity** - the tension between elasticity and discipline
- _MoE/SoV_: **legitimacy** - the tension between "bad" and "good" money
- _SoV/UoA_: **solvency** - the tension between deflation and inflation

Here we explore the Unit of Account, and its tension with the Medium of Exchange, what we call *liquidity*.

## Origins: Reproducing Families and States

The Unit of Account allows us to denominate debts. 
It is an accounting device for managing the reproduction of human societies.
But where does it come from and what does it account for? 

Consider that there are two distinct origins of money, and with them the Unit of Account. We might
call these the "anthropological" origin and the "political" origin. The
anthropological origin is embedded in the logic of kinship, of dowries and
wergeld, payments for brides and for transgressions.[^anthro-origin] This origin gives us the
deep association between terms for sin, debt, guilt, and terms for money[^guilt-debt]. 
We take this to be the older of the two, a staple of the paleolithic. 
The political origin is embedded in the logic of accounting, states, and writing, 
of grain inventories and tax collection, credits and payments for food and labour. 
This origin appears more recent, a fabrication of the neolithic and the need to
account for surplus.

Something strange appears to have taken place some 5000 years ago as these
two threads became intimately bound up and entangled with one another, setting
the stage for what we recognize as the 5000 year history of monetary
institutions. But we would do well to keep track of their difference - for as we will
see, each flows in its own way, representing different kinds of circuits, and a
basic distinction between outside and inside money. 

In anthropological money, the accounting follows the logic of kinship and
religion, of the circulation of reproductive power (women) and justice (divine grace).
Units of Account are taken from nature in the form of stable quantities of valuable 
material private possessions  that represent wealth - heads of cattle (or people), 
units of shell or gems, bracelets of silver. 
These are prized and accumulated for their practically religious value.
But they do not necessarily become generalized media of exchange, used to lubricate markets.
Rather, they are used to denominate payment in a certain circuit of social obligations by
virtue of their prestige - their ability to store value.

In political money, accounting follows the logic of redistributive states, 
of the accumulation and distribution primarily of grain. It is tied up deeply in
the origin of writing, which emerges primarily as an extension of earlier token-based accounting techniques.[^early-writing]
This accounting is a process of creating new, persistent computational spaces to represent - and thereby manage - 
reproduction on a much grander scale. It constitutes a new medium for denominating and clearing obligations - 
ultimately, a new medium of money.
But with it implies a new kind of obligation, a new way to exert power over an
individual's future. 

The Unit of Account for the new written medium was most famously standardized in the early temple
palaces of Mesopotamia as an equivalence between a weight of silver 
and a count of barley grains - the shekel.[^uoa-standardization]
A shekel was worth a month's pay of barley.
In some sense, our present monetary disorder is the 5000 year consequence 
of the shekel.

## Hey, there's metal in this money!

The Unit of Account likely began as a standardized count of barley - the grain. 
But at some magical moment, a certain count of grain was equated with a weight
of silver. How and why this equivalence came about, we can only speculate.
Gold, silver, and copper were surely already seen as prestige goods, with
jewellry and other metal artifacts being found in burials throughout the 4th millennium BC. 
Copper as a metal had significant utility, and had become the basis for a new
kind of technological revolution - this was the "Calcolithic", the Copper Age,
which was about to give way in the late 4th millenium BC to the also copper-based Bronze Age.
But gold and silver were much less useful. Perhaps they were already in
use as a kind of anthropological money, with jewellry and other artifacts being
paid as dowries or in tribute to the gods. There is also speculative evidence
that metal axes, too small or fragile to be actually useful, may have functioned
as a kind of proto-currency, as they have been found throughout early
societies.[^axes]

No doubt, the equivalence between a weight of silver and a count of grain was
facilitated by the metaphorical properties of weight - something all matter
shares. Indeed, it seems the origins of measurement standards and metrollogy also lie
in the late 4th millenium BC, and this is an area where metals,
and especially precious metals, actually have a direct utility - by way of their density, as a weight. 
Perhaps it was the earliest metal weights, representing masses of real goods (grain, oil, etc.),
that would motivate the equivalence between weights of metal and the settlement
of debts denominated in grain. A large count of grain would have, on average, a
roughly consistent weight, which could be represented by a much smaller object,
a weight of silver. The word shekel itself even means "to weigh" - but also, "to
pay."

This was also a time, in the late 4th millenium BC, 
when abstract numbers may not have existed yet - computation 
was done with literals. Meaning perhaps the unit of the shekel, a weight of silver equivalent
to say 180 grains of barley, emerged to faciltiate computation with larger
numbers. We will never really know. But this metaphorical equivalence between
the weight of metal and the count of grain has come to dominate our thinking on
money. Millenia old traditions recount that money is a metaphor, a substance
which can stand in for all other substances. But money is not just metaphor, 
a means of assessing quantitative equivalence - money is metonym, a means to
sequence debt denomination and clearing.[^drumm-metonym] 

So we have two distinct origins of money, an anthropological one and a
political one and they are fused in the temple palaces some 5000 years
ago into a kind of money that uses a standard weight of silver as the Unit of Account - the shekel.
The shekel served as an accounting device, especially for denominating and
clearing inter-departmental debts within the palaces. But it was also used to
denominate debts that could be settled by a Medium of Exchange - 
primarily, a count of grain, though to a lesser extent, weights of silver. 
Counts of grain served as the primary medium of exchange for the majority of payments, 
which were smaller, while weights of silver served for larger, usually mercantile transactions.
Different media of exchange flowing in different circuits of obligation.

Over time, weights of silver would come to play an increasingly important role
as a Medium of Exchange, up to and beyond the introduction of coinage in the
~7th century BC. Thus for *two thousands years*, up to and even beyond the
introduction of coinage, money was defined in terms of a weight of metal.
And finance, even a thousand years before coinage, 
was surprisingly modern.[^modern-assyria] While coinage is no doubt an important development,
money is a much older phenomenon.

## Outside In, Inside Out

While anthropological money flows in a web through
kinship circuits to balance the circulation of natural, religious, and reproductive powers, 
the defining circuit of political money 
is the simple *fiat loop* between the state and the individual, between state spending and taxation,
denominated in the state's Unit of Account. 
This loop is made possible by writing, but it is instantiated with a new kind of
power by the link between the written nominal unit and the instrinsic weight of material - 
between the UoA and the value stored in its medium. 

The Unit of Account offers us the ability to denominate unlimited amounts of debt, 
to define entire ecosystems of unhinged money inside our written accounts. An
inner world of pure elasticity. But it is balanced, even disciplined by an
exterior, an outside world of scarce physical weighted value, 
substantiated outside the confines of the written asylum in the hard reality of
precious things. Thus we confront the duality of inside and outside money. 
Inside money is written money, it's money that is someone else's liability, 
money that is but an IOU. It is our political money. Outside money is
physical money, it's no one's liability (but nature's!), it is pure asset. It is our
anthropological money. The history of money, since the shekel, is one of a great
tension between these two types, between inside and outside, nominal
and metal, political and anthropological. Between the Unit of Account and Medium of
Exchange. 

With the introduction of coinage in the 7th century BC, the Medium of Exchange would
begin an evolutionary trajectory towards ever more accessible and prominent forms.
We will have more to say about coins and the development of media of exchange
later on. But the technology of written accounts - of accounting - would not evolve considerably 
for another thousand years until the development of Hindo-Arabic numerals and Islamic
bookeeping techniques in the late first millenium AD.[^islamic-bookeeping] As
these techniques collided with the new paper technology and paper money
radiating out of China, the confluence of advances in accounting and writing technology once
again breathed fresh life into the Unit of Account, unlocking powerful new mechanisms 
for debt denomination to restructure society. These mechanisms would be most
famously weilded by the merchant bankers of Renaissance Italy as they ignited a
banking revolution.

## Balancing the Books

The distinction between inside and outside money opens up a kind of hierarchy,
rooted in outside money, and branching into increasingly contained insides.
We call this the Hierarchy of Money, and it starts to develop in earnest with
the emergence of bookeeping and banking, and accelerates with the adoption of bank deposits as 
means of exchange. Bank deposits are the most common example of the emergence of
a widely successful inside money.

Bookeeping and banking enabled clearing activities to flourish.
Clearing allows debts to be settled by balancing txs within and across balance sheets,
without resorting to a medium "higher" in the hierarchy. If I owe you, I can pay
you with outside money like gold - this is the highest level in the hierarchy. 
But if we both have an account at the same bank, I can pay you by the bank simply 
updating its balance sheet to owe me less and you more - so we can clear debts at a 
lower level in the hierarchy, without resorting to gold, directly on the bank's balance sheet. 
And if you and I have continuous bilateral obligations, where I owe you and
later you owe me, we could continuously renew and redeem monetary debts to
one another without ever having to transfer any kind of money at all, just by keeping bilateral accounts
between ourselves - the lowest level in a hierarchy of money, our
own IOUs. 

This hierarchy is a hierarchy of computational spaces, where each space
constitutes its own medium for the denomination and settling of debts. The line begins to blur
between the Unit of Account and Medium of Exchange, as the balance sheets on
which we account become media themselves for clearing debts. And so the
term Medium of Exchange becomes more relative, generally meaning a medium one level up from where you 
denominate your debts.

So you and I can keep track of what we owe eachother, and maybe do some clearing, 
but our real Medium of Exchange is our bank deposits, which we'll use to settle
our debts if an imbalance between us persists too long. But if we bank at
different banks, those banks will have debts to one another, which they might be
able to clear bilateraly, but if imbalances persist too long, they will also
have to rise to a higher level in the hierarchy to settle, for instance with the
Medium of Exchange of bank reserves on the balance sheet of the central bank. 

The point of all this is to demonstrate that access to a higher level of the hierarchy - 
to the medium of exchange - is only necessary in so far as there are *imbalances* in 
the payments graph being cleared in the lower level. 
We find here the deep tension between the Unit of Account and the Medium of
Exchange - between the elasticity permitted by the Unit of Account and the discipline asserted by the Medium of Exchange. 
The Unit of Account permits us to create computational spaces - our network of balance sheets - where 
we can account for debts and clear them against eachother.
But to the extent there is insufficient bandwidth or capacity in that space,
insufficient balance across our sheets, computation must spill out into a medium higher in the hierarchy, 
in order for debts to settle. This is the process at the heart of the financial
system: settlement. The Unit of Account lets us denominate and clear debts against eachother,
but it takes a Medium of Exchange to settle them.

## Settling Up

The Unit of Account allows debts to be denominated, but it does not in itself prescribe
how they should be settled. Many governments will endow a particular medium of exchange
with legal tender status (eg. bank notes), 
while other media of exchange continue to be used alongside them (eg. fintech).
Debts can also be settled in-kind, which is to say by something else valued in the Unit of Account
equivalently to the original debt. This implies storing value somewhere else
besides the medium of exchange, and using it to settle debt when necessary, if
possible. But arguably, the ideal way to settle is not to settle at all but to clear - 
to bypass the transfer of any medium of exchange altogether, and instead maintain 
a pattern of reciprocol obligations that can be netted. I owe you,
and later, you will owe me, and so on. Monetary transactions without the use of
any money.

This isn't barter, since it's not synchronous. 
Invoices are being issued and cleared in a Unit of Account. 
These are deferred payments. But to the extent opposing
payments can be simply set-off against eachother, 
no generally accepted medium of exchange need come into existence at all - 
value is instead stored in the real world, 
in the continuous productive capacities of the
recipricol agents. This is what allows us to do clearing, to perform monetary
computation without resorting to the liquidity of a medium of exchange.

Of course, most agents don't have fully recipricol relations like this, allowing them
to avoid payment in the Medium of Exchange by just clearing in the Unit of Account. I pay my accountant for their services, 
but they don't pay me for anything (at least not
yet!), so I can't do any clearing with them - I have to pay them cash. 
Again, the Medium of Exchange is only needed in so far as there
are imbalances in the payments graph. But every firm has many customers and many vendors, 
and collectively they continuously create and renew a vast network of payment obligations (the "trade
credit" network), which is at the core of the real economy.

Within this network, we can ask about the patterns of flow, and in particular whether there
are closed loops ("cycles") that can be cleared without the need for
balances in a medium of exchange to materialize or flow. 
If I owe Abed $10 and Abed owes Troy $6 and Troy
owes me $4, we can clear what's common ($4) from all of them, leaving everyone
only owing the difference ($6 for me and $2 for Abed). 
The Medium of Exchange is needed only in so far as there are imbalances in the payment graph.

IMAGE

By mapping the obligation graph and identifying cycles, we can *save* liquidity.
We need less money for the same volume of transactions, just by taking advantage
of existing structure in the graph. All forms of clearing can be considered
effectively as increasing the [velocity of money](/velocity.md). 
But the presence of these cycles, and the opportunity to clear them, presents 
as a much more profound thing that requires and supports a 
greater degree of colaboration. It suggests a way for us to
quantify the quality of our money: quality money flows in
cycles.[^energy-cycles]

## Wherefore Art Thou Liquiity?

But not all money flows in cycles, at least not on a short time horizon, which
means even if we clear everthing in cycles, there are debts left over -
imbalances in the payments graph.
More anxiously, then, we might ask how these imbalances, built up in the networks of trade and finance,
might relate to the general availability of the Medium of Exchange required to settle them.
Say, to the extent that obligations are not part of closed loops that can be
netted out, where and how are we to get the media to clear them all? And why should there be enough of it? 
Wherefore art thou liquidity?

This tension, between the elasticity of the Unit of Account and the discipline of the Medium of Exchange,
is what the entire edifice of banking and central banking has
historically been charged with navigating - to enable payments to continue flowing, to
keep things *liquid*. Notably, at the trade fairs of the 16th century and earlier, 
before the rise of central banks, 
a huge volume of European credit was settled by netting out obligation cycles and
collapsing chains of obligations in a decentralized clearing process called
the *rescontre*.[^rescontre] The process was so efficient, the merchant-bankers hardly needed
to use any money at all, and generally only brought enough with them for their personal
expenses. These fairs were phenomenal in their pursuit of balancing the payments
graph.

But this balancing act would soon give way to a new institutional form.
By the end of the 16th century, the institutions of money found themselves on the precipice of 
a transformation from engine of trade to engine of war finance. Not that money
hadn't for two millenia or more been intimitately tied up in war. But a monetary and
financial revolution was looming that would institutionalize a new kind of imbalance: 
the permanent debts of the state. Responsibility for monetizing these debts was
distributed across a new kind of banking system taking hold of Europe, anchored
by Central Banks.

As central banks and centralized clearing unions came to take over from the 
decentralized clearing fairs, they would introduce a new kind of money, the bank "reserves",
that could function as a Medium of Exchange within the clearing union. 
Global trade moved from a system of global ghost currency units, used
primarily for accounting and clearing, to one of global *reserve* currency
units, used to provide liquidity. Attention turned from balancing the payments graph to issuing enough
reserves. We transitioned from a quality theory of money to a quantity theory.

Concerns continue to abound as to the problem of responsibly issuing reserves,
most commonly today in the context of an explosion of reserves on the balance sheets
of the world's central banks. The debate rages over what these reserves are and what they
matter for. Are they even money? If so, they're only money for banks, and most 
interbank transactions don't use them anyways. The problem of liquidity is
buried in the shadows of the network of bank balance sheets and the credits they create with
one another. But inconcistencies and imbalances in these networks periodicially spill over
into the visible realm of bank reserves in the great liquidity crises of banking history.

## Booking the Balance

Historically, economic thought had largely failed to theorize
correctly about this tension in the structure of the payments graph - about the
problem of liquidity - despite a complex and sophisticated payments system
developing before and alongside it in the form of Europe's great banking networks. 
Of course the bankers themselves weren't particularly keen to write treatises
divulging the secrets of their business, and often operated with more than a
flair of secrecy. Thus the discovery of economics in the academy found itself 
largely bound up in theorizing about mutual gains to trade, where trade was
conceived in the form of barter, and the temporal structure of the trade
credit and payments system that served as the actual engine of trade was practically ignored.
Instead, the cheap or practically free availability of liquidity provided by
dealers was taken for granted almost as a form of mysticism, 
until it would seize up in the recurrent
liquidity crises of the last few centuries, only to be remythologized by the
action of great priests employed by the world's central banks. 

Ability to theorize about these problems wasn't wholly absent, however.
In the 19th century, Marx identified a tendency towards liquidity crisis in
capitalism, though his analysis remained more theoretical than institutional.
Walter Bagehot, on the other hand, investigated the institutional structure of
liquidity and conjured the famous Bagehot rule hailed as the foundation of
modern central banking practice. But neither seemed to focus in on the core
network structure, on the need to balance the payments graph. Marx infamously
advocated for political revolution, while Bagehot advocated for a more
responsible management of reserves.[^bagehot-freebanking]

The 20th century, in Europe, especially, saw growing recognition of the
importance of this problem, of balancing the payments graph via clearing rather
than perennially issuing reserves to support settlement.
Keynes' *bancor* proposal at Bretton Woods, 
which was based on EF Schumachers work on multi-lateral
clearing,[^schumacher] was a recognition of the need to balance the 
global payments graph between countries leveraging a global ghost Unit of Account - the bancor.
Of course Keynes' plan failed in favour of an American gold-exchange standard
and American management of the issuance of global monetary reserves - the USD. 
But USD liquidity wasn't sufficient to reboot European economies amidst the tangled
web of bilateral trade relations that emerged after the war. It took the
European Payments Union to do that, an institution designed to balance the
payments graph amongst its members by transferring those bilateral relations to
multilateral ones that could be cleared.[^end-of-finance-epu]
The EPU was deemed such a success they thought they no longer
needed it, and tragically shut it down after less than 10 years.
Later (TODO when?), when the US had become the world's largest debtor,
and was pushing for the creation of new reserve assets at the IMF (the
SDRs), the European representatives insisted that there was no need for more
reserve assets, but rather a need to balance the payments
graph.[^superimperialism]

These calls to balance the payments graph harken back to the trade fairs,
which were able to clear huge volumes of trade without the need for almost any
external liquidity - the graph was balanced. How it came to be
unbalanced, and how the financial system transitioned from a principle of
clearing (that is, liquidity saving) to one of liquidity (that is, liquidity
provisioning), is a deep historical question that may lie at the heart of the
large-scale destructive effects of capitalism on the world.

## Collaborative Finance

Money, its instabilities, and the anxieties it produces, are age old phenomena.
As a technology of debt denomination, money posits a discipline of predicting
the future, predicting the ability for people to pay back debts. 
But these predictions regularly fail as imbalances build up in the obligation graph from a multitude
of sources, including natural shocks, internal mismanagement, and the institutional
power structure itself. It is the prerogative of Sovereignty to address
this problem, to define the means to relieve overbearing debts. 

Before coinage, states relieved debt through jubilee, where the ruler
periodically declared the relief of non-commercial obligations. With coinage, 
a new sovereign power to manage debt emerged in the spread between the
nominal and intrinsic value of the coin - the sovereign could enforce, at least
locally, and within some constraints, that the coin was worth more than the metal inside it.
Reducing the amount of metal in the coinage thus became a means of effecting debt
relief. Of course this capacity could also be greatly abused by the sovereign
itself, to relieve its own debts.

Capitalism is marked by a new kind of debt relief, an
institutionaliation of the debts of the sovereign in a manner
in which they are never really expected to be paid back - they are perenially
deferred by becoming money. This perennial rolling over of debt gives cover to a
new scale of accumulation and growth, the results of which are apparent all
around us. 

The liquidity risk that defines the banking system has been the major focus
of central banks in the 20th century, though they have largely failed to properly
understand its nature and how to address it. Instead, they have become captured
by a paradigm of systemic risk,[^captured-risk] and find themselves compounding
moral hazard at the heart of the financial system by providing debt relief on an
adhoc basis to reckless financial institutions and other large firms. These
efforts have completely undermined the real economy, and while central banks
think they are creating oceans of liquitity to drench the world in, the small
and medium sized enterprises at the heart of the economy have been virtually cut
off. Since the collapse of the eurodollar engine in 2008, and especially since
the Basel III regulations came into place, liquidity has all but vanished.

Fortunately, there is hope, and it does not depend on the coordinated action of
large players. Rather, modern technology allows us to revisit the magic
mechanisms of the trade fairs to enable clearing across large numbers of firms
without any liquidity at all. Networks of trade can fight back against the
entrenched powers and their hoarding of liquidity through explicit
collaboration, restoring the medium of exchange as a vehicle for clearing debts,
not for accumulating value.

We call this new approach [Collaborative Finance (CoFi)](https://cofi.informal.systems).
The CoFi perspective is focused on understanding the payments graph itself -
mapping it, finding cycles, clearing them, and encouraging their sustainable growth.
But it also gives us new insights into the optimal injection of liquidity into
the graph - namely, liquidity can be injected in ways that optimize for network
level properties, rather than being injected on an ad-hoc and discretionary
basis to individual nodes by banks. This has the potential to transform the
realm of commnunity financing and banking, not to mention how we measure
sustainable economic growth itself.

At the heart of this thinking is the problem of imbalances in the payment graph - 
what can't be accounted for and thus cleared in the UoA alone,
and how they must "spill out" into the domain of the Medium of Exchange. 
We turn to the Medium of Exchange, and its tension with the Store of Value, next.
Stay tuned.

By the mid-3rd millenium, Sargon of Akkad ruled over the world's first empire and standardized the measurement system across city states, 
leading to a more precisely defined shekel.
[^anthro-origin]: Ingham (2004) similarly distinguishes two origins of money
    the first based on an institutionalization of public debts to society (the
    Wergeld type), the second on the "need to calculate equivalencies of goods in the
    agrarian command economies." Hudson (2004) distinguishes three origins; one
    is wergeld, two is feasts (TODO), and the third is our political money. We
    combine Hudson's first two in our "anthropological" money. Notably, these
    sources do not emphasize the role of dowries and bridewealth. The critical role of
    dowries, bridewealth, and women in early monetary circuits and logic is
    explored more fully by the Mimbres School.
[^modern-assyria]: See Veenhof (1997). For instance by the early 2nd millenium BC there is full blown 
profit-seeking arbitrage trade, denominated in silver, and organized as investment contracts. 
Goods were exported from Mesopotamia to Anatolia where they were exchanged for silver 
that could be brought back to Mesopotamia. As Mesopotamia had no silver mines and had already monetized
silver, the metal was much dearer there than it was in Anatolia, which did have
silver mines and where silver's monetization was less developed. Hence the
emergence of a silver arbitrage trade.
[^rescontre]: See Borner & Hatfield (2017) for a historical overview as well as economic analysis of the Pareto 
efficiency of these mechanisms. Merchant bankers met quarterly at the fairs with
their books of bills of exchange and spent a few days finding chains and loops of bills
with others at the fair that could be cleared. This decentalized clearing
was ultimately disrupted by the rise of central banks and clearing houses which,
though technically less Pareto efficient, were able to incentivize use through
other means.

[^bagehot-freebanking]: Bagehot is famous for his advice to central banks,
    that in times of crisis they should "lend freely, at high interest, on good
    collateral, to solvent firms". This is the "Bagehot rule".
    While lip service continues to be paid to Bagehot and his rule, the only part 
    actually followed is to "lend freely", but alas, at low interest, on junk
    collateral, to insolvent firms. Notably, and less well known, Bagehot was
    actually against the system of central banking, and preferred a system of
    competitive note issue between private banks, where each bank held and
    managed its own gold reserves, rather than pooling them all with the Bank of
    England. See, for instance, the openning to the concluding chapter in Bagehot (1873).
    This is known as "free banking," and is not to be confused with the much
    less responsible "wildcat banking" that emerged in 19th century USA. Sound
    free banking systems thrived during the 19th century in Scotland and Canada.
