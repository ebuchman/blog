*This is part I in a [series on the properties of
money](/properties-of-money)*

In the introduction we outlined the properties of money:

- the _Unit of Account_ is for denominating debts
- the _Medium of Exchange_ is for clearing debts, here and now
- the _Store of Value_ is for clearing debts, elsewhere or later

And the tensions between them:

- _UoA/MoE_: **liquidity** - the tension between elasticity and discipline
- _MoE/SoV_: **legitimacy** - the tension between "bad" and "good" money
- _SoV/UoA_: **solvency** - the tension between deflation and inflation

Here we explore the Unit of Account, and its tension with the Medium of Exchange, what we call *liquidity*.

## Origins: Reproducing Families and States

The Unit of Account allows us to denominate debts. 
It is an accounting device for managing the reproduction of human societies.
But where does it come from and what does it account for? 

Consider that there are two distinct origins of money, and with it the Unit of Account. We might
call these the "anthropological" origin and the "political" origin. The
anthropological origin is embedded in the logic of kinship, of dowries and
wergeld, payments for brides and for transgressions. This origin gives us the
deep association between terms for sin, debt, guilt, and terms for money. We take this to be the
older of the two. The political origin is embedded in the logic of accounting, states, and writing, 
of grain inventories and tax collection, credits and payments for food and labour. 
This origin is more recent, beginning some 5000 years ago. But throughout the 5000 year history of
monetary institutions, these two threads have become intimately bound up and
entangled with one another. We would do well to keep track of their difference - for as we will
see, each flows in its own way, representing different kinds of circuits, and a
basic distinction between outside and inside money. 

In anthropological money, the accounting follows the logic of kinship and
religion, of the circulation of reproductive power (women) and justice (divine grace).
Units of Account are taken from nature in the form of stable quantities of valuable material private possessions 
that represent wealth - heads of cattle (or people), units of shell or gems, bracelets of silver. But these do not
necessarily become generalized media of exchange, used to lubricate markets - they
are used to denominate payment in a certain circuit of social obligations. 

In political money, accounting follows the logic of redistributive states, 
of the accumulation and distribution primarily of grain. It is tied up deeply in
the origin of writing, which emerges primarily as an extension of earlier token-based accounting techniques.[^early-writing]
This accounting is a process of creating new, persistent computational spaces to represent - and thereby manage - 
reproduction on a much grander scale. It constitutes a new medium for denominating and clearing obligations - 
ultimately, a new medium of money.

The Unit of Account for the new written medium was most famously standardized in the early temple
palaces of the Near East as an equivalence between a weight of silver - the
shekel - and a count of barley grains.[^uoa-standardization]
A shekel was worth a month's worth of barley.
In some sense, our present monetary disorder is the 5000 year consequence 
of what would happen to the shekel. 

## Hey, there's metal in this money!

The Unit of Account was effectively a standardized weight (of barley). 



And since weight is a
property all materials share, it was not much of a leap for a more convenient and
durable substance of an equivalent weight to stand in for grain, 
especially one which was already sentimentally charged, 
perhaps even one which had already been in use as an anthropological money.
In this way, precious metals came to take the place as the Medium of Exchange and Store of
Value in an accounting system predicated on weights of grain as the Unit of
Account. 

So we have two distinct origins of money, an anthropological (outside) one and a
political (inside) one and they are fused in the temple palaces into a kind of
money that uses a standard weight of grain as the Unit of Account, an equivalent
weight of silver as the Medium of Exchange, and silver as the Store of Value,
and which persists for at least a couple thousand
years before the introduction of coinage in the ~7th century BC. 
In other words, money was weighed metal for *two thousand years* before it became countable coins.

While anthropological money flows in a web through
kinship circuits to balance the circulation of reproduction, the defining circuit of political money 
is the simple *fiat loop* between the state and the individual, between state spending and taxation,
denominated in the state's Unit of Account. This loop is made possible by writing, but it is effectuated
by the link between the written nominal unit and the instrinsic weight of material - between the
UoA and the value stored in its medium. 

The Unit of Account offers us the ability to denominate unlimited amounts of debt, 
to define entire ecosystems of unhinged money inside our written accounts. An
inner world of pure elasticity. But it is balanced, even disciplined by an
exterior, an outside world of scarce physical weighted value, 
substantiated outside the confines of the written asylum in the hard reality of
precious things. Thus we confront the duality of inside and outside money. 
Inside money is written money, it's money
that is someone else's liability, money that is but an IOU. It is our political
money. Outside money is
physical money, it's no one's liability (but nature's!), it is pure asset. It is our
anthropological money. The history of money, since the shekel, is one of a great
tension between these two types of money, between inside and outside, nominal
and metal, political and anthropological. 

With the introduction of coinage, the Medium of Exchange would
gain a new kind of accessibility and prominence. We will have more to say about
coins in a later piece. But the technology
of written accounts - of accounting - would not evolve considerably 
for centuries until the development of Arabian mathematics and related
bookeeping techniques in the late first millenium AD. 
And as these developments found their way to Italian merchant banking
communities in the ~13th century AD, they breathed new life into the Unit
of Account, unlocking powerful new mechanisms for debt denomination to restructure
society.

## Balancing the Books

The distinction between inside and outside money opens up a kind of hierarchy,
rooted in outside money, and branching into increasingly contained insides.
We call this the Hierarchy of Money, and it starts to develop in earnest with
the emergence of bookeeping and banking, and accelerates with the adoption of bank deposits as 
means of exchange. Bank deposits are the most common example of the emergence of
a widely successful inside money.

Bookeeping and banking enabled clearing and netting activities to flourish.
Clearing and netting allow debts to be settled by balancing txs within and across balance sheets,
without resorting to a medium "higher" in the hierarchy. If I owe you, I can pay
you with outside money like gold - this is the highest level in the hierarchy. 
But if we both have an account at the same bank, I can pay you by the bank simply updating its balance sheet to owe me less
and you more - so we can clear debts at a lower level in the hierarchy, without resorting to gold, 
directly on the bank's balance sheet. 
And if you and I have continuous bilateral obligations, where I owe you and
later you owe me, we could continuously renew and redeem monetary debts to
one another without ever having to transfer any kind of money at all, just by keeping bilateral accounts
between ourselves - the lowest level in a hierarchy of money, our
own IOUs. 

This hierarchy is a hierarchy of computational spaces, where each space
constitutes its own medium for the clearing of payments. The line begins to blur
between the Unit of Account and Medium of Exchange, as the balance sheets on
which we account become media themselves for the clearing of payments. And so the
term Medium of Exchange becomes more relative, generally meaning a medium one level up from where you 
denominate your debts.

So you and I can keep track of what we owe eachother, and maybe do some netting, 
but our real Medium of Exchange is our bank deposits, which we'll use
if an imbalance between us persists too long. And while banks can do simple
netting between accounts kept at their own bank, payments between accounts at
different banks require them to go another level up the hierarchy, to the
Medium of Exchange of bank reserves. And so on. 

The point of all this is to demonstrate that access to a higher level of the hierarchy is only necessary in so far as 
there are *imbalances* in the payments graph being cleared in the lower level. 
We find here the deep tension between the Unit of Account and the Medium of
Exchange - between the elasticity permitted by the Unit of Account and the discipline asserted by the Medium of Exchange. 
The Unit of Account permits us to create computational spaces - our network of balance sheets - where 
we can account for debts and net out payments.
But to the extent there is insufficient bandwidth or capacity in that space,
insufficient balance across our sheets, computation must spill out into a medium higher in the hierarchy, 
in order for debts to settle. This is the process at the heart of the financial
system: settlement.

## Settling Up

The Unit of Account allows debts to be denominated, but it does not in itself prescribe
how they should be settled. Many governments will endow a particular medium of exchange
with legal tender status (eg. banknotes and coins), while other media of exchange
continue to be used alongside them (fintech, banks).
Debts can also be settled in-kind, which is to say by something else valued in the Unit of Account
equivalently to the original debt. This implies storing value somewhere else
besides the medium of exchange, and using it to settle debt when necessary, if
possible. We might think of this as basically deferring to barter. But arguably,
the ideal way to settle is to bypass the transfer of any medium
altogether, and instead to have a pattern of reciprocol obligations. I owe you,
and later, you will owe me, and so on. Then we can just keep netting, without
needing to use money.

This isn't barter, since it's not synchronous. Invoices are being issued and settled in a Unit of
Account. We might call it countertrade on credit, since both sides make reference to a common unit of account 
and payment may be deferred, but no generally accepted medium of exchange need come into existence at all, because opposing
payments are simply set-off against eachother. Value is instead
stored in the real world, in the continuous productive capacities of the
recipricol agents. This is what allows us to do netting, to perform monetary
computation without resorting to the liquidity of a medium of exchange.

Of course, most agents don't have fully recipricol relations like this, allowing them
to avoid payment in the Medium of Exchange by just netting in the Unit of Account. I pay my accountant for their services, 
but they don't pay me for anything (at least not
yet!), so I can't do any netting with them - I have to pay them cash. 
Again, the Medium of Exchange is needed in so far as there
are imbalances in the payments graph. But every firm has many customers and many vendors, 
and collectively they continuously create and renew a vast network of payment obligations (the "trade
credit" network), which is at the core of the real economy.  

And within this network, we can ask about the patterns of flow, and in particular whether there
are closed loops ("cycles") that can be netted without the need for
balances in a medium of exchange to materialize or flow. 
If I owe Abed $10 and Abed owes Troy $6 and Troy
owes me $4, we can net out what's common ($4) from all of them, leaving everyone
only owing the difference ($6 for me and $2 for Abed). 
The Medium of Exchange is needed only in so far as there are imbalances in the payment graph.

## Wherefore Art Thou Liquiity?

More anxiously, then, we might ask how the imbalances in the network of payment obligations
built up in the trade credit networks (and more broadly, the financial networks) might
relate to the general availability of the Medium of Exchange required to settle those imbalances.
Say, to the extent that obligations are not part of closed loops that can be
netted out, where and how are we to get the media to clear them all? Wherefore art
thou liquidity?

This tension, between the elasticity of the Unit of Account and the discipline of the Medium of Exchange,
is what the entire edifice of banking and central banking has
historically been charged with navigating - to enable payments to continue flowing, to
keep things *liquid*. Notably, at the trade fairs of the 16th century, before the rise of central
banks, a huge volume of European credit was settled by netting out obligation cycles and
collapsing chains of obligations in a decentralized settlement process called
the reconstro. The process was so efficient, the merchant-bankers hardly needed
to use any money at all, and generally only brought enough with them for their personal
expenses. These fairs were phenomenal in their pursuit of balancing the payments
graph.

But this balancing act would soon give way to a new institutional form.
By the end of the 16th century, the institutions of money found themselves on the preicipice of 
a transformation from engine of trade to engine of war finance. A monetary and
financial revolution was looming that would institutionalize a new kind of imbalance: 
the permanent debts of the state. Responsibility for monetizing these debts was
distributed across a new kind of banking system taking hold of Europe, anchored
by Central Banks.

As central banks and centralized clearing unions came to take over from the clearing fairs, 
they would introduce a new kind of money, the bank "reserves",
that could function as a Medium of Exchange within the clearing union. Concerns
continue to abound as to the problem of responsibly issuing such reserves,
most commonly today in the context of an explosion of reserves on the balance sheets
of the world's central banks. The debate rages over what these things are what they
matter for - if they're money, they're only money for banks, and most 
interbank transactions don't use them anyways. The problem of liquidity is
buried in the shadows of the network of bank balance sheets and the credits they create with
one another. But inconcistencies and imbalances in these networks periodicially spill over
into the visible realm of bank reserves in the great liquidity crises of banking history.

Historically, economic thought had largely failed to theorize
correctly about this tension in the structure of the payments graph - about the
problem of liquidity - despite a complex and sophisticated payments system
developing before and alongside it in the form of Europe's great banking networks. 
Of course the bankers themselves weren't particularly keen to write treatises
divulging the secrets of their business, and often operated with more than a
flair of secrecy. Thus the discovery of economics in the academy found itself 
largely bound up in theorizing about mutual gains to trade, where trade was
conceived in the form of barter, and the temporal structure of the trade
credit and payments system that served as the actual engine of trade was practically ignored.
Instead, the cheap or practically free availability of liquidity provided by
dealers was taken for granted almost as a form of mysticism, 
until it would seize up in the recurrent
liquidity crises of the last few centuries, only to be remythologized by the
action of great priests employed by the world's central banks. 

Ability to theorize about these problems wasn't wholly absent, however.
Europe, esepcially, has a long history of it.
Keynes' *bancor* proposal at Bretton Woods, 
which was based on EF Schumachers work on multi-lateral
clearing,[^schumacher] was a recognition of the need to balance the 
global payments graph between countries.
Of course Keynes' plan failed in favour of an American gold-exchange standard.
But USD liquidity wasn't sufficient to reboot European economies amidst the tangled
web of bilateral trade relations that emerged after the war. It took the
European Payments Union to do that, an institution designed to balance the
payments graph amongst its members by transferring those bilateral relations to
multilateral ones. The EPU was deemed such a success they thought they no longer
needed it, and shut it down after less than 10 years.
And later, when the US had become the world's largest debtor,
and was pushing for the creation of new reserve assets at the IMF (the
SDRs), the European representatives insisted that there was no need for more
reserve assets, but rather a need to balance the payments
graph[^superimperialism]. 

These calls to balance the payments graph harken back to the trading fairs,
which were able to clear huge volumes of trade without the need for almost any
external liquidity - the graph was balanced. How it came to be
unbalanced, and how the financial system transitioned from a principle of
clearing (that is, liquidity saving) to one of liquidity (that is, liquidity
provisioning), is a deep historical question. 
But whether from malice or incompetence, the legacy of devastation wrecked by
these chronic imbalances inthe  monetary and financial system is a travesty. 

We can confront the incompetence, at least, with a new generation of 
scholarship that puts the problem of liquidity front and
center in understanding money and banking - for instance,
Perry Mehrling's "[Money View]" and his excellent [MOOC] on
the matter. But more then this, we need to center the problem of balancing the
payments graph. At Informal Systems, 
we call this [Collaborative Finance (CoFi)](https://cofi.informal.systems) - a new science of liquidity savings and injection. 

The CoFi perspective is focused on understanding the payments graph itself -
mapping it, finding cycles, clearing them, and encouraging their sustainable growth.
But it also gives us new insights into the optimal injection of liquidity into
the graph - namely, liquidity can be injected in ways that optimize for network
level properties, rather than being injected on an ad-hoc and discretionary
basis to individual nodes by banks. This has the potential to transform the
realm of commnunity financing and banking, not to mention how we measure
sustainable economic growth itself.

At the heart of this thinking is the problem of imbalances in the payment graph - 
what can't be accounted for and thus cleared in the UoA alone,
and how they must "spill out" into the domain of the Medium of Exchange. 
We turn to the Medium of Exchange, and its tension with the Store of Value, next.
Stay tuned.
