The primary factors of production in economics are generally taken to be land, labour, and
capital. Sometimes secondary factors are added, of raw materials and energy,
with the distinction that the primary factors are not "used up" by production,
while the secondary factors are. Associated with each primary factor of production is a share of the
total income, the rent, wages, and interest earned respectively. 




pa sort of heterodoxbbb
synthesis, that more fundamentally accounts in its social theory for the natural
relationships between the factors of production themselves. In so doing we will
attempt to justify why Energy and Money should be considered
independent factors of production, along with Land, Labour, and Capital.

problem
- trouble with neoclassical economics 
- oversimplify labour and capital - capital controversy
- fail to represent energy - georgescu roegen
- fail to represent money - mmt ? 
    - money wasnt supposed to be a factor of production, but became one ?
- incomplete social theory of the factors of production
- neoclassical revolution - marginal utility encourages a purely economic view
  of the production function. economics depoliticized.
- economic theory of capital, energy, and money have been seriously impaired
- perhaps it is worth revisiting the factors of production


this work
- review mainstream factors of production
- sketch a theory - a heterodox synthesis
    - account for the natural relationships between the factors of production
    - include energy and money 
- remarks on each of the 5 factors

review factors of production
- primary: land, labour, capital
- secondary: materials, energy
- income: rent, wages, interest
- production function - 
    - focus on labour and capital
    - carried away with marginal utility analysis
- capital - fixed, working
- capital and money insufficiently represented
    - cambridge controversy -> Post-Keynesians
    - Hyman Minsky, MMT - money not in the math, its in the balance sheets
    - austrian capital theory ignored
- energy not considered well
    - georgescu-roegen
    - ecological economics
    - schumacher


sketch new theory 
- consider relationships between the factors themselves
- land is the lowest-order factor, others emerge from land in higher orders: labour, capital, energy, money
- Each factor transforms the dimensionality of the field of production
- Each factor has a cost to employ: rent, wages, natural interest, entropy, money interest
- Each factor feedback on those lower than it 
- Each factor is deserving of a social theory and institutions that uphold it
- Fictitous commodities and the non-economic
  

land
- the origin. natural world. all natural resources.
- generally accepted private property on land, charging of rent
- but acquisition of land in the first place is everywhere ethnic cleansing or
  genocide
- indiginous theory has no private ownership of land - stewards
- henry george. private property only applies to the fruits of labour
- land value is due to community. rent is purely extractive
- single tax
- land bubbles and the trade cycle ?
- ecological economics

labour
- space dimension
- the things that come out of the land - the "individuals" - they make time
  tradeoffs - new dimension (?)
- humans come out of the land
- require cooperation with other humans
- providing for yourself requires access to land
- like any other animal, its labour is for its survival
- augments the dimensionality of land with the behaviours of the species
- but does not in itself manage time - doesnt represent its boundaries - tornado
  like
- human labour notably distinct becauase of possibility of trade
- some "core" labour not so much for trade - more "care" work.
    - feminist economics
    - military like drafts ?
- self sufficiency (local mrkets) vs luxury (global trade) ? 
- fictitious commodity - labour is actual human life
- wages ...
- coops - Robert Owen
- commons - Elinor Ostrom
- labour transforms the land

capital
- time dimension
- emerges from labour acting on land, making a time tradeoff
- robinson crusoe - time, discounting
- types of capital:
    - private tools - tools - birds nest, hammer, etc. 
    - public tools - networked goods - language, money systems
    - private natural - naturally productive - plants and animals
    - public natural - ecosystem investments, biodiversity
- intellectual property - copyright vs patents
    - patents turn public tools to private tools - like with land
- only private capital (tools and natural) can be loaned - usually at interest
    - interest in kind
    - tools: interest is compensation for "wear"
    - natural: interest is compensation for fructification
- heterogenous capital structure and the stages of production
    - Post-Keynesians, Austrians
- capital allows representing boundaries - need to match capital structure to
  current and future requirements of civilization
- organizational/institutional capital - tango with labour
- too much capital interferes with labours ability to provide for itself (!)
    - like a kind of rent
    - usually due to higher energy use
    - forces you to need money
- interest
    - moral prescriptions against - something inhernetly wrong
    - wear and fructification
    - discounting bills a way around usury
    - interest and time preference
    - competition for savings - does it exist without money ?
    - money rate vs natural rate
- capital transforms labour and land


energy
- energy dimension
- capital intensive process of production - can't be powered just by labour
  anymore
- requires capital "energy goods" (oil) and infrastructure (engines) 
- operate far beyond human scale - huge augment of production
- old - even smelting thousands of years ago
- scales of energy. from basic fire to nuclear. basic fire is more capital - its
  on human scale.
- industrial revolution a huge energy transformation
- cost of energy is entropy - not part of income, but major externality
- Georgescu-Roegen, Schumacher, Ecological Economics
- damages land - climate change
- damages labour - inhibits ability to provide for self
- damages capital - complex, fragile production processes? high dependence on
  energy ...



money
- coordination dimension (?) value dimension (?)
- early grain credit money is part of capital - doesnt require energy
    - same with basic double entry book keeping
- money and energy
    - distinguish basic "local" money (that is effectively capital) from a more "global" money that depends on energy ? 
    - money a symptom of not being able to produce what you need
    - only once we start using so much energy do we get inhibited from producing for ourselves, and hence need money
    - gold mining/melting requires energy
    - international gold system based on industrial energy use
    - war finance
- money a tool for exchange
    - best money doesnt even materialize (!) credit clearing
    - cash as a hedge for uncertainty
    - cash/demand-deposits should decay - 0 at least, if not negative interest
- banks
    - elasticity of money - response to demand
    - maturity transformation
    - money rate of interest
    - money, time, and the yeild curve
- money in the production function 
    - maturity transformation
    - intertemporal equilibrium
    - money as a reflection or shadow of the production function
    - interlocking balance sheets
- new theory of money - scale dependence
    - money as a reflection of the energetic processes
    - interdependence between amount labour is inhibited and the scale of money
    - sustainability based optimum currency area
    - fractal hierarchy of money
- transforms
    - land
    - labour
    - capital
    - energy



promise and redemption in every factor ? 


land - george, ecological
labour - institutional, feminist
capital & money - austrian, post-keynesian
energy - ecological
