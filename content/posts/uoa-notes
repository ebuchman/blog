Notes
- writing allows UoA to be written, used for deliberate compute
- pre writing UoAs were more "organic" compute (?). kinship logic vs state logic
- writing allows new MoEs to emerge - be constructed
    - previous MoEs were materials. tuned to circuits of exchange.

- origin of money in the accounting for reproductive and destructive capacity: 
    - dowries.  
        - circulation of women
    - sacrifice
        - circulation of justice
- logic of kinship
- when it starts to get written down, get a new sort of state money. writing was
  first done by states.

- mention dawn of everything, cyclic societies

... clean this up. 
... clarify how debts can be cleared with outside money / assets. distinction
     between them - one is availability of liquidity, other of value. liquidity
     supposed to represent future value.
... clarify how an inside money becomes its own medium of exchange.
... clarify bilateral but balanced invoincing




... MoE as stand in for higher up the hierarchy. 
 .... computational spaces that can function effectively as a medium for
 payments to be cleared, but term Means of Exchange is typically used to refer
 to the medium one level up the hierarchy. So for debts at one level of the hierarchy, which can be cleared directly on the accounting medium, 
 their effective Medium of Exchange is one level up the hierarchy.
 So you and I can keep track of what we owe eachother, and maybe do some
 netting, but our real Medium of Exchange is our bank deposits, which we'll use
 if an imbalance between us persists too long. And while banks can do simple
     netting between accounts kept at their own bank, payments between accounts at
     different banks require them to go one level up the hierarchy, to the
     Medium of Exchange of bank reserves. And so on.

But each inside faces also an outside, a world of
potentially incompatible political money systems, ones where the books might
disagree. Such differences are disciplinewd 

While metal was money for 2000 years before coins, the introduction of coinage 
made the technology of money far more accessible. And as a distribution
mechanism embroiled in the financing of war, coins offered their sovereigns the
opportunity to explore the spread between nominal units of account and the
amount of metal embedded in their media of exchange.


private property as religious origin


The early states introduced a
fundamentally new kind of circuit that would shapew

The UoA provides a means of doing accounting, of managing resource
allocation within a society. Within smaller tribes, the Unit of Account provides
accounting for reproductive capacity and its redistribution throughout 
kinship networks. In the early states, the Unit of Account provides
accounting for the accumulation of grain inventories and their redistribution throughout the
population. In so far as only grain was involved, the UoA (say, shekel) was used to denominate
grain debts, which would be settled literally in grain. In this way, grain could
be seen as comprising all three of the UoA, the MoE, and the SoV.

The Medium ofExchange of precious metals would ultimately give way to that of bank deposits in an ever evolving 
Hierarchy of Money. But the ability to do clearing and netting at each level in the hierarchy 

If everyone I do business with uses the same bank, and I'm liquid, all my payments can be
settled on the bank's balance sheet, without resorting to a higher level in the hiearchy 
(like cash or bank reserves).
